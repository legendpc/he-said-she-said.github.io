00:00 < brianloveswords> rauchg: you could be that someone!
00:00 < sh1mmer> wat
00:00 < sh1mmer> crazy
00:00 < sh1mmer> rauchg: I keep meaning to make the dns server not suck
00:01 < sh1mmer> I would <3 it if we could make a super fast node dns server/resolver implementation
00:16 < aandy> i see express.session requires a secret. it runs with and without giving express.cookieParser the same secret (and none). can anyone explain what the signifigance is here? am i suppose to provide the secret to both, or is cookieParser only relevant if i store non-session related info aswel?
00:17 < sh1mmer> *mutter mutter* node-gyp *mutter*
00:17 < rauchg> aandy cookieParser just parses 
00:17 < sh1mmer> aandy: without looking at it I assume the secret is a salt
00:17 < rauchg> session encodes/decodes
00:17 < rauchg> with secret
00:18 < sh1mmer> e.g. the session gets hashed with the salt
00:18 < sh1mmer> and then when it verifies it looks for the same salt
00:19 < aandy> well, it's a generic secret for all, so i'd assume it's signing the session cookie also
00:20 < aandy> rauchg: and .session parses it too, so strictly speaking it's not needed to work with sessions, it's more if i want to use req.cookies.session (or whichever), correct?
00:20 < aandy> s/parses/decodes
00:21 < rauchg> aandy session doesn't parse cookies
00:21 < rauchg> cookieParser yields req.cookies
00:21 < rauchg> session looks at req.cookies and yields req.session
00:22 < aandy> right, i meant decoding it
00:22 < aandy> so if i wanted to see the session id it has from the cookie, i'd parse it with the same secret
00:22 < sh1mmer> aandy: from the client side?
00:22 < aandy> no server side
00:22 < sh1mmer> yes
00:23 < sh1mmer> such salts are typically server config not code
00:23 < sh1mmer> or they should be
00:24 < aandy> ok, so cookieParser is "merely" to parse the cookies and attach as an object? just making sure i'm not disabling this and messing some other express/connect dependency up
00:24 < gbhatnag> hi all! trying to do ajax uploads with express + file-upload jquery plugin (https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) -- running into problems parsing the file on POST and using formidable to handle progress/other events
00:24 < gbhatnag> any ideas/docs on how best to do ajax file uploads in Express?
00:34 < chovy> had a co-worker tell me nested callbacks is a bad way to program.
00:34 < chovy> "you should never be doing nested callbacks"
00:34 < gabrieluk> gbhatnag, https://encrypted.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=express.js+ajax&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
00:35 < gabrieluk> chovy, http://callbackhell.com/
00:35 < chovy> he's one of those "i'm better than you types"
00:35 < mono__> oooooh
00:35 < Oddman> chovy, he's right though
00:35 < Oddman> should be working off promise objects instead
00:35 < jmoyers> jesus
00:35 < jmoyers> why do IT folks have to be such nazis about server names
00:35 < mono__> Hod
00:36 < mono__> God
00:36 < Oddman> jmoyers, haha
00:36 < jmoyers> nodejsdev01… really? REALLY?
00:36 < jmoyers> im about to have a psychotic break and start sudoing the shit out of this bitch
00:37 < gabrieluk> jmoyers, huh?
00:37 < jmoyers> sorry, just ranting about my IT guys :P
00:37  * gabrieluk is his own IT guy
00:39 < chovy> Oddman: all my code is callbackhell
00:39 < chovy> how should i organize these files if i want to modularize them all?
00:39 < gnarf> isaacs: so btw - npm ls doesn't do this either
00:40 < gnarf> my package.json currently wants grunt ~0.3.17
00:40 < gnarf> and i have 0.3.9
00:40 < gnarf> i would still need the parse
00:40 < gbhatnag> thanks, gabrieluk -- I guess I'm specifically interested in handling an ajax upload via formidable within express - will keep searching
00:41 < gabrieluk> haha, no probs. I'm in the same situation. I want to make some ajax stuff with express. but I'm also considering to jump straight away into websockets/socket.io/sock.js, etc...
00:42 < Oddman> chovy, obviously some callbacks are warranted
00:42 < Oddman> but if you have more than a few levels deep of callbacks, try using promise objects
00:42 < chovy> Oddman: i have to get a user a lot
00:42 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder reviewme * f729b53 : repl: call resume() after setRawMode()  Solves #4178, but does not fix th (+371 more commits) - http://git.io/kNcIlA
00:42 < chovy> but that needs a callback, so how would i use a module that does nothing but get a user.
00:43 < chovy> do i pass my cb into the require statment?
00:43 < Oddman> if that's your only issue I fail to see that's a problem - but yes, that could work
00:43 < chovy> Item.findById(id, require('user').getUser(function(err, user){ });
00:43 < chovy> like that?
00:44 < chovy> seems impossible to not nest
00:44 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder reviewme * 6822488 : repl: call resume() after setRawMode()  Solves #4178, but does not fix th - http://git.io/mrFXfQ
00:45 < Oddman> yeah, again - it depends on context
00:46 < Oddman> and Item won't return a promise object, so you can't use that approach there, either
00:48 < gnarf> isaacs: you still around?
00:50 < chovy> Oddman: https://gist.github.com/6bc9633926652a18d2ae
00:50 < chovy> this iw ath i've been doing
00:51 < chovy> functions that don't take callbacks i put in ./modules
00:51 < chovy> but i don't see how to not nest callbacks here
00:51 < sh1mmer> aye. apparently I'm running stuff on 0.2.1 and 0.6.7 :/
00:52 < Oddman> chovy, yeah you can't - but I'm pretty sure the mongo library you use has some examples of getting aroun dit
00:53 < Oddman> also those requires inline scare me. Do you know how well node handles repeat requires like that?
00:53 < Oddman> curious
00:53 < chovy> no
00:53 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder master * 6822488 : repl: call resume() after setRawMode()  Solves #4178, but does not fix th - http://git.io/pOWeAw
00:54 < chovy> Oddman: how is it any different than assigning it? Obviously if I"m calling more than one function I would assign the require first
00:54 < chovy> var ItemMod = require('./modules/item');
00:54 < chovy> ItemMod.notFound(err);
00:56 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder v0.8 * f34f1e3 : repl: call resume() after setRawMode()  Solves #4178, but does not fix th - http://git.io/w9Je2g
00:58 < Oddman> chovy, it's about semantics, really
00:58 < Oddman> which is better - defining that which you need first (the node preferred method), or pulling it in as you need it?
00:59 < Oddman> node recommends doing your requires first, like you would with most app development so you can see the dependencies straight away
00:59 < Oddman> there's no digging through code to figure that out
00:59 < Oddman> obviously in your example, that's a pretty mundane topic cos your file is only 12 lines long or so
01:00 < chovy> Oddman: i see
01:00 < chovy> i usually put the requires at the top of the function
01:00 < Oddman> exactly :)
01:00 < Oddman> so why break the mould there?
01:01 < jden|plane>  /nick jden
01:01 < chovy> is there any naming convention for modules?
01:01 < chovy> I'm using Item for model
01:01 < chovy> and item for instance
01:01 < chovy> need one for module
01:05 < ericelliott> chovy: No.
01:13 < cpsubrian> OK lets say a module exposes a CLI for for global use.  Is there any way other modules could extend the main one by globally installing them?  Think like output formatters for a log browser.
01:14 < zombor> hello, can anyone help? I'm trying to install socket.io, but i get this error: https://gist.github.com/3943114
01:14 < Oddman> chovy, I prefer to name them as such
01:15 < Oddman> ie. item = instance
01:15 < Oddman> ItemModel = model
01:15 < Oddman> item = new ItemModel.etc.
01:15 < Oddman> just a bit easier to separate the two

01:19  * jden is bad at this game
01:19 < jwulf> zombor, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12926416/socket-io-install-errors
01:20 < jwulf> you're on ubuntu?
01:20 < zombor> yeah
01:20 < zombor> jwulf: ive seen that, it didn't help
01:20 < zombor> i installed node.js from source
01:21 < jwulf> zombor, any reason for doing that?
01:22 < zombor> because the version in the package manager was old
01:22 < zombor> and didn't work at all
01:24 < Girls_Escort> Porn SEx Girls http://fredfilms.blogspot.com
01:25 < aandy> smooth move
01:26 < zombor> anyone have any ideas?
01:26 < chovy> Oddman: ok
01:26 < jwulf> zombor, i use creatonix's nvm to install node on my Fedora system
01:26 < jwulf> you can have multiple versions installed, and switch between them
01:27 < zombor> i dont have or want multiple versions ;)
01:27 < jwulf> zombor, try it again with sudo -- hammer approach, but might help you to isolate the cause
01:27 < chovy> i probably use models more than anything else, so I will keep those Item and probably just do ItemModule
01:27 < zombor> jwulf: i tried with sudo
01:27 < jwulf> same result?
01:27 < zombor> pretty much
01:27 < jwulf> pretty much, or exactly?
01:27 < jwulf> because that's important
01:28 < zombor> yep, same error
01:28 < zombor> Fatal error: can't create Release/reader_1.o: No such file or directory
01:29 < jwulf> zombor, i don't see that line in https://gist.github.com/3943114
01:30 < zombor> yeah, im in tmux, couldn't copy all that...let me see
01:31 < zombor> jwulf: my gist is updated
01:34 < jwulf> zombor, i think you are missing a dependency needed to compile the wscat binary
01:34 < zombor> shouldn't it be included?
01:35 < jwulf> hmm.. no it's not a binary, it's a javascript file on my system
01:36 < timeturner> is there a way to have tmux recognize touch events from putty?
01:36 < timeturner> like resizing panes
01:36 < timeturner> that owuld be cool
01:36 < timeturner> would*
01:38 < jwulf> zombor - dumb question - y ou have free space on your disk?
01:39 < jwulf> EROFS means "Error Read-Only File System"
01:39 < jwulf> so it is unable to create the symlink
01:39 < jwulf> the very first line npm ERR! Error: EROFS, symlink '../ws/bin/wscat'
01:39 < jwulf> that looks like the first symptom there
01:39  * deoxxa nods
01:39 < jwulf> the npm installer cannot write files that it needs to
01:39 < zombor> jwulf: yup, GBs and GBs
01:39 < jwulf> that's why I suggested running it as root
01:40 < deoxxa> zombor: can the user npm is running as write to it?
01:40 < zombor> yup
01:40 < jwulf> is it a local filesystem or remote?
01:40 < zombor> it's all local, this is a vagrant virtual machine
01:40 < jwulf> ubuntu?
01:40 < zombor> hmmm... wonder if it has anything to do with the shared folders
01:40 < zombor> yeah, ubuntu
01:41 < zombor> crap, yeah it works in ~
01:42 < deoxxa> zombor: sounds like the FS doesn't support symlinking stuff
01:42 < deoxxa> zombor: despite being writable
01:42 < deoxxa> maybe you're trying to symlink across volumes or something? (guessing)
01:42 < zombor> dunno, it's effectively a virtualbox shared folder
01:42 < zombor> so it is a different volumn
01:42 < zombor> e
01:42 < deoxxa> https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/453 << similar issue
01:43 < jwulf> zombor, it's a filesystem writing issue
01:43 < jwulf> so try doing it on a different volume, in a /tmp directory, etc
01:43 < jwulf> to try to isolate the factor
01:43 < zombor> jwulf: yeah, i said i tried it in ~, and it worked
01:43 < broofa> Anyone know if there's been movement on getting a proper SSL cert for npmjs.org, ala https://github.com/isaacs/npm-www/issues/127 ? (cc isaacs)
01:43 < jwulf> ok, so what's the difference between ~ and where you are doing it now?
01:44 < jwulf> because that is the cause
01:44 < zombor> jwulf: ~ is native, and my code folder is a virtualbox shared folder
01:44 < zombor> so basically, i can't use node on virtualbox with shared folders
01:44 < deoxxa> broofa: seems to be the correct certificate now
01:45 < deoxxa> zombor: specifically you can't symlink things apparently - there might be an option to remove that restriction within vbox or something
01:45 < broofa> deoxxa - https://registry.npmjs.org/
01:45 < deoxxa> ah
01:45 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
01:46 < deoxxa> you didn't mention registry.npmjs.org ;)
01:46 < jwulf> zombor, might help: http://askubuntu.com/questions/22824/cant-modify-files-in-my-shared-folder-virtualbox-guest-is-ubuntu-host-is-win
01:46 < broofa> deoxxa - my bad :)
01:46 < zombor> i can do `cd ~; ln -s project/package.json .`
01:47 < zombor> but i can't do the opposite
01:47 < jwulf> https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10085
01:47 < deoxxa> that's definitely weird
01:47 < zombor> % ln -s node-v0.8.12.tar.gz harpoon/node.tar.gz
01:48 < zombor> ln: failed to create symbolic link `harpoon/node.tar.gz': Read-only file system
01:48 < deoxxa> i wonder if there's a way to work around it
01:48 < jwulf> conclusion: 
01:48 < jwulf> "I would love to hear of any option for creating symlinks, aside from either creating them via the host (which is a pain) or downgrading to VB 4.1.6 (rather not do that).
01:48 < jwulf> Needless to say, many applications rely on symlinks. Not being able to create them from the guest really limits the value of shared folders for me."
01:48 < zombor> yeah, looks like that issue is the same
01:49 < jwulf> yes, you cannot install socket.io on a virtual box shared folder
01:49 < jwulf> unless you downgrade to VB 4.1.6
01:51 < zombor> yeah, i dont know if i want to do that, there's bugs on that version too :)
01:52 < zombor> vagrant needs to hurry up and finish vmware support
01:52 < zombor> ok, well thanks for your help
01:53 < mdedetrich> bleh
01:53 < mdedetrich> I'm getting a ../src/Canvas.h:19:10: fatal error: 'cairo/cairo.h' file not found error when trying to install canvas
01:54 < deoxxa> ur a bleh
01:54 < mdedetrich> even though cairo is installed
01:54 < mdedetrich> deoxxa: ur mums a bleh
01:54 < deoxxa> :o
01:54  * deoxxa looks at canvas
01:54 < mdedetrich> basically exact same issue this guy has https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/issues/225
01:55 < deoxxa> hmm
01:56 < mdedetrich> I'm on a mac osx lion using home-\brew (for cairo)
01:56 < jwulf> mdedetrich, on a linux system this would mean that you need to install the -devel package
01:56 < jwulf> so that you get the source headers
01:57 < mdedetrich> is there a brew formula for this
01:57 < deoxxa> i bet pkg-config is broken
01:57 < deoxxa> it likes breaking
01:58 < mdedetrich> jwulf:it actually installed the herder files as well
01:58 < mdedetrich> jwulf: /usr/local/Cellar/cairo/1.12.2/include/cairo
01:58 <@Nexxy> so do I
01:58 < mdedetrich> jwulf: so that def aint the issue
01:58 < jwulf> mdedetrich, 
01:58 < jwulf> "I've uninstalled the pixman and cairo libs installed via brew so that canvas would use the libraries that come with MacOS:"
01:58 < jwulf> https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/issues/184
02:00 < mdedetrich> aah bingo
02:00 < mdedetrich> brew link cairo
02:00 < mdedetrich> did it
02:00 < mdedetrich> cheers jwulf 
02:01 < jwulf> great! glad it helped
02:01 < mdedetrich> honestly it may be a smarter idea for node packages that link to sources to just sandbox and come with the bundled sources
02:01 < mdedetrich> for each platform
02:05 < deoxxa> mdedetrich: some do
02:06 < deoxxa> mdedetrich: sometimes they even come with compiled dependencies, which is always nice
02:06 < deoxxa> mdedetrich: but it's not always practical (like if something depends on boost, which is about a zillion megabytes)
02:06 < mdedetrich> silly hippies, not including source
04:00 < mappum> what do you guys think of ender? it still seems like jquery is the defacto standard, is ender big enough that people i work with will be familiar with it?
04:01 < themiddleman> I love the idea but it's way too hard to "look something up in the docs"
04:05 < cainus> hey all... anyone know of some magic to figure out how many args a function takes *without calling it*?
04:05 < niggler> you can't cainus 
04:05 < niggler> because javascript lets you play with 'arguments
04:05 < niggler> !mdn arguments
04:06 < cainus> seems like mocha manages this somehow
04:06 < niggler> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
04:06 < cainus> yeah I can definitely do it by calling it ;)
04:06 < themiddleman> cainus: function.length
04:06 < niggler> themiddleman: that's just how many explicit variables are mentioned
04:07 < themiddleman> niggler: correct
04:07 < cainus> beautiful
04:19 < mynodey> I created a js object with FunctionTemplate::New -- does this object get collected when it is out of scope?
04:34 < rvagg> mappum: ender is awesome, if your people are familiar with jQuery then ender is largely compatible when you add the bits you need
04:35 < mappum> rvagg: so is there an ender alternative for all of the jquery api? like would i be able to switch without changing any code?
04:35 < rvagg> not quite all, but the most important bits
04:36 < rvagg> mappum: bean for events, bonzo for most DOM manipulation, qwery for a selector engine--or even sizzle if you want, domready for $.ready(), reqwest for AJAX
04:36 < rvagg> mappum: traversty for more advanced DOM traversal
04:37 < rvagg> `ender build jeesh` will give you domready, bean, bonzo qwery, the most commonly used components, add reqwest if you need ajax
04:37 < rvagg> mappum: https://github.com/ender-js/Ender/wiki/Ender-package-list
04:37 < mappum> awesome, thanks
04:37 < mscdex> such cutesy names
04:37 < chrishatton> hey all ... question on "npm install -g blerg"
04:37 < niggler> wtf is jeesh?
04:37 < chrishatton> default install on OS X 10.8 is not where i'd like...how can I change?
04:38 < chrishatton> ➜  ~  npm -g bin
04:38 < chrishatton> /usr/local/share/npm/bin
04:38 < chrishatton> (not in PATH env variable)
04:39 < mscdex> chrishatton: i think you can use --prefix during ./configure
04:40 < chrishatton> thx mscdex ... any idea on how to "fix" permanently?
04:40 < chrishatton> .gitconfig?
04:40 < mscdex> add it to your path?
04:40 < ChrisPartridge> chrishatton: add it to your path?
04:40 < mscdex> ;-)
04:40 < heypaul> sudo mv oldLocation newLocation
04:40 < mscdex> ha
04:40 < mscdex> or symlink
04:40 < rvagg> niggler: `jeesh` is like a virtual package in ender that'll install the ender starter pack, domready, qwery, bono, bean
04:40 < chrishatton> just don't want to do it everytome
04:40 < chrishatton> everytime
04:41 < ChrisPartridge> chrishatton: add it to your profile
04:41 < mappum> rvagg: does it install underscore and backbone? those are listed under "core" on your link
04:41 < rvagg> mappum: you can install them into your build if you like, `ender build jeesh underscore backbone`
04:42 < mappum> ok, i just didnt know if they were a part of jeesh
04:42 < chrishatton> thx guys ... but would rather fix npm, then my set up
04:42 < rvagg> mappum: just those 4 libs are part of jeesh
04:42 < mappum> ok
04:43 < mscdex> chrishatton: it has nothing to do with npm, it has to do with how you installed node/npm
04:43 < chrishatton> with homebrew, mscdex
04:43 < mscdex> homebrew sucks
04:43 < ChrisPartridge> +1
04:43 < chrishatton> lol
04:43 < chrishatton> then what do you guys use?
04:43 < mscdex> compile from source or use the prebuild package on nodejs.org
04:43 < mscdex> *prebuilt
04:44 < chrishatton> fair enough ... I dig ... I'll 86 the homebrew install for node/npm
04:45 < rvagg> chrishatton: if you're a heavy node user then you may want to just keep the joyent/node git repo around and checkout each release for a compile & install, it's super easy
04:45 < rvagg> chrishatton: then you can switch in and out of 0.9 if you feel like it
04:45 < chrishatton> thx rvagg ... I am 
04:45 < ChrisPartridge> nvm (or the other version managers) are pretty sweet too
04:46 < chrishatton> new macbook and was looking to get back on my feet asap, so I took some shortcuts
04:46 < rvagg> and... when you compile, make -j X where X is the number of cores you have available and it'll fly by
04:47 < matthieu> hi, I have an issue with an add-on I've written that under some very specific condition it causes a spawned process to crash
04:47 < matthieu> error is: ../deps/uv/src/uv-common.h:101: uv__req_unregister: Assertion `uv__has_active_reqs(loop)' failed.
04:48 < chrishatton> nice tip, rvagg ... did not know about make -j
04:48 < ChrisPartridge> rvagg: ender is interesting, will this essentially remove my dependency on requirejs?
04:48 < matthieu> addon is at https://github.com/matthieu/node-gc/blob/master/nodegc.cc
04:48 < rvagg> ChrisPartridge: yes, requirejs can go jump
04:48 < matthieu> any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm stumped
04:49 < rvagg> matthieu: you can find advanced libuv-type help in #libuv if nobody here can answer
04:49 < matthieu> @rvagg: ok, thanks for the tip
04:51 < cha0s> I'm trying to do this: Handle<Function> require = Context::GetCurrent()->Global()->Get(String::New("require")).As<Function>();
04:51 < cha0s> Inside a member function of a wrapped C++ object in my node extension
04:51 < cha0s> but it's coming up IsUndefined(), anyone know why?
04:52 < cha0s> I'm gonna go peek at node's source but I figured I'd ask here in case anyone can save me the trouble
04:54 < rvagg> cha0s: `require` is a strange beast, it wouldn't surprise me if it was available there
04:54 < rvagg> s/was/wasn't
04:55 < cha0s> It would be a shame if I couldn't, since I need it in some constructors. Otherwise I would just proxy around it.
04:55 < rvagg> cha0s: `require` is a special instance for each module/file you load, could you fetch it from the caller perhaps?
04:56 < cha0s> I guess I'm just wondering why it isn't in the Context::GetCurrent, it has to exist in some symbol table...
04:56 < cha0s> Maybe I need GetCalling
04:57 < rvagg> cha0s: start by poking around in lib/module.js to see how it works
05:00 < cha0s> I think it's higher than that, since there are require calls at the top of that file too...
05:05 < rvagg> is it just me that can't get http://2013.jsconf.us/ to load? I've only had the spinner since I started trying to load it yesterday
05:07 < Robdgreat> maybe someone else is on the site and you'll have to wait your turn
05:07  * Robdgreat engages in mindless irrational conjecture
05:15 < mscdex> rvagg: same here, looks like they haven't started on it yet? :-)
05:19 < rvagg> mscdex: people keep talking about it on twitter as if there's content there though!
05:20 < rvagg> Robdgreat: my ponderings make me wonder if it's for americans to view only
05:20 < ChrisPartridge> rvagg: proxy time
05:20 < rvagg> ChrisPartridge: it's not a plausable enough thought to bother
05:23 < qmx> rvagg: must be the CIA proxy
05:23 < qmx> :)
05:24 < Robdgreat> mscdex: haven't started it yet, but have it set up so that as soon as it's ready, you'll be able to see it. Very clever
05:25 < Robdgreat> rather, it'll load for you the instant it's ready
05:25 < rvagg> fwiw: https://twitter.com/search?q=2013.jsconf.us
05:26 < rvagg> oh man! view-source
05:26 < cha0s> Does EventEmitter support event namespacing?
05:26  * rvagg slaps forehead
05:26 < rvagg> cha0s: try EventEmitter2
05:27 < rvagg> cha0s: https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2
05:27 < cha0s> I actually already have an EventEmitter class written that does, so I was just wondering if it'd be worth keeping it around... I'm taking that as a yes ;)
05:28 < rvagg> yes, I think the point of core EventEmitter is that it's so heavily used that it's optimised for performance and not special use-cases like namespacing which may slow it down a little
05:29 < ChrisPartridge> rvagg: Is there something similar to the text plugin (in requirejs), for ender?
05:30 < qmx> rvagg: :)
05:30 < cha0s> Yep, at the very least namespacing increases space complexity
05:40 < rvagg> ChrisPartridge: what does the text plugin do?
05:47 < ChrisPartridge> rvagg: essentially allows me to keep all my templates in html format in the project (ease of access for the front end guys), and just use 'text!location/of/template.html'
05:47 < ChrisPartridge> s/front end/ui
05:47 < rvagg> ChrisPartridge: ah, unfortunately not that I'm aware of
06:01 < TehShrike|Work> butts?
06:02 < TehShrike|Work> Wait, guys, guys
06:02 < TehShrike|Work> Did you know
06:02 < TehShrike|Work> Your functions are objects too???
06:03 < TehShrike|Work> YOU CAN EVEN GIVE THEM PROPERTIES
06:07 < deoxxa> TehShrike|Work: what the heeeeeck
06:08 < TehShrike|Work> IT'S TOTALLY NUTS
06:08 < TehShrike|Work> Dude get this
06:08 < TehShrike|Work> If you want to
06:08 < TehShrike|Work> You can even pass in functions as arguments to OTHER FUNCTIONS
06:08 < Zoney> uhm
06:11 < TehShrike|Work> It gets even crazier though - if you want to skip inheriting from various classes, it turns out that you can just use objects to determine shared behavior/data, and use that stuff on instanced objects using this wacky "prototyping" thing
06:11 < TehShrike|Work> It's seriously weird, but I'm starting to suspect that it may just be the bomb
06:27 < abrkn> is mongolian dead?
06:51 < thesteve0> hey folks - thanks again for your help a couple of weeks ago with my Express middleware documentation question
06:51 < thesteve0> here is the blog post that came out of it
06:51 < thesteve0> https://openshift.redhat.com/community/blogs/using-nodejs-mongodb-express-for-your-spatial-web-service-and-its-free
06:51 < thesteve0> there is a shout out to this channel in the post
06:52 < hemanth_> thesteve0, nice
06:52 < sinclair> any C# developers here?
06:53 < thesteve0> hemanth_:  glad you like it
06:53 < hemanth_> thesteve0, if at all rpm and deb packaging were as easy as npm....don't you feel so? 
06:53 < thesteve0> hemanth_:  ??
06:54 < hemanth_> thesteve0, well, this is not related to your article, but in general....
06:54 < thesteve0> Nexxy:  that post is the one you helped answer the questions on - Sorry I don't remember who else helped in that discusssion
06:54 < thesteve0> well the NPM problems space is small than deb or rpm
06:55 < thesteve0> I actually prefer apt-get to yum
06:55 < hemanth_> rather, the deps are managed well?
06:55 < hemanth_> did you know npm packages are more than gems!?
06:55 < TehShrike> On npm, dependencies don't make me sad
06:55 < hemanth_> TehShrike, yes i would love if debian packages where the same!
06:56 < TehShrike> Package management is hard
06:56 < hemanth_> boring, rather than hard
06:56 < hemanth_> too much of boiler plate 
06:56 < TehShrike> Except in the really weird cases where weirdos delete their packages from NPM, I find that it is just an excellent thing that makes my life better
06:56 < sinclair> does anyone here write their own node toolchains?
06:57 < hemanth_> anyone playing around with phantom.js?
06:57 < TehShrike> sinclair: what's a toolchain?
06:57 < sinclair> TehShrike: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain
06:58 < hemanth_> sinclair, https://github.com/airportyh/testem ?
06:58 < hemanth_> sinclair, did you look at yeoman?
06:58 < sinclair> hemanth_: i've started writing a node automatic build app with C# 
06:59 < TehShrike> Who would write their whole toolchain in node?
06:59 < hemanth_> sinclair, well sorry I'm not aware of M$ $tuff
06:59 < hemanth_> why not?
06:59 < sinclair> hemanth_: what's m$?
06:59 < hemanth_> sinclair, any guess?
06:59 < TehShrike> File editors have become so advanced in the last decade
06:59 < TehShrike> Why would you rewrite your own in node?
07:00 < sinclair> hemanth_: some dated anti Microsoft sentiment ?
07:00 < TehShrike> Most likely.
07:00 < TehShrike> I like Windows 7, myself.
07:00 < hemanth_> TehShrike, need not re-write, but may write wrappers and make a toolchain?
07:00 < hemanth_> sinclair, yes sir.
07:00 < sinclair> hemanth_: stop it, there is nothing wrong with Microsoft
07:01 < TehShrike> hemanth_: I'm sorry, I'm going off of toolchain based on the wiki article you linked to
07:01 < TehShrike> If you mean something less than "everything a programmer uses" perhaps you should say that, instead
07:01 < sinclair> anyway, i develop in TS, and automatically build JS 
07:02 < hemanth_> TehShrike I did not link that :)
07:02 < hemanth_> sinclair, read what RMS has to say about M$
07:02 < TehShrike> hemanth_: ah you are correct, my apoligies
07:02 < sinclair> who is RMS?
07:02 < TehShrike> *apologies
07:02 < TehShrike> Richard Stallman, I assume
07:02 < hemanth_> yes 
07:03 < sinclair> who cares about RMS
07:03 < TehShrike> lol
07:03 < sinclair> no one
07:03 < TehShrike> Well
07:03 < TehShrike> Let me put it this way
07:03 < sinclair> i don't base my opinions on the opinions of others. 
07:03 < TehShrike> More people care about what he says than what you say
07:04 < TehShrike> Not to say that I agree with him more than I agree with you
07:04 < sinclair> doing so leads to frustration, for example, i tried asking people in this channel what node is good for. no one could tell me.
07:04 < TehShrike> sinclair: writing software
07:04 < sinclair> TehShrike: so is so many other languages / frameworks, why choose node?
07:05 < sinclair> the only answer i had was "JS is fun"
07:05 < sinclair> which is a dumb answer
07:05 < TehShrike> Really?
07:05 < TehShrike> I mean, there are other answers that could trump it
07:06 < TehShrike> But I consider it a valid answer
07:06 < TehShrike> I've written enterprise, business-running applications in C++
07:07 < TehShrike> And whenever I look at one of our screens, I think to myself "this would be so simple in JS"
07:07 < TehShrike> But even if they weren't simpler
07:08 < TehShrike> I think "it would be more fun to write" is totally viable
07:08 < sinclair> TehShrike: anyway, i found my own uses for node, the thing is, i HATE anti microsoft bullshit, its lame
07:08 < TehShrike> Now, CoffeeScript would probably be more fun to write than JS, but I don't write it, for various reasons
07:08 < sinclair> unless you have a "good" reason to hate MS, then you are nothing more than a sheep
07:09 < TehShrike> sinclair: I use Windows 7, it is my favorite operating system of the moment, I've been using MS operating systems for 15 years
07:09 < TehShrike> I will argue the merits of a given operating system with anyone
07:09 < TehShrike> But I'd rather not, because it's such a boring discussion
07:09 < sinclair> things like, winRT and restricting developers to subset apis to prevent applications executing code in virtual mem, or IE's lack of WebGL, it secure boot
07:10 < TehShrike> WinRT doesn't make me sad
07:10 < TehShrike> But the confusion in marketing when it comes to WinRT vs Win8 does make me sad
07:10 < timeturner> unix is awesome
07:10 < TehShrike> Consumers have no idea which is which (imo)
07:11 < timeturner> windows is awesome for media players and games
07:11 < TehShrike> unix is awesome at what it does
07:11 < timeturner> so you bridge the two via putty and you have awesomesauce
07:11 < TehShrike> And, for the people who really want unix to do everything, it's pretty good
07:11 < timeturner> it's difficult to get unix to do everything
07:12 < TehShrike> But a leet person doesn't mind
07:12 < TehShrike> And I will never diss a leet person for using unix to do anything
07:12 < TehShrike> Because I can 100% understand their motivation
07:12 < rendar> TehShrike: i agree
07:12 < sinclair> TehShrike: you shouldnt have to be 1337 to use an operating system, language, or whatever
07:12 < TehShrike> So I will keep using Windows, and appreciating it, but I won't knock anyone else for their OS choice
07:13 < TehShrike> sinclair: and that's why there is Windows and OSX
07:13 < sinclair> TehShrike: i can't stand people who refer to Microsoft as M$
07:13 < sinclair> that;s all
07:14 < TehShrike> I mostly just ignore it
07:14 < TehShrike> I first saw that nomenclature over a decade ago
07:15 < TehShrike> It makes people feel witty
07:16 < jaha> anyone know how to change delimiters in Handlebars.js?
07:16 < sinclair> TehShrike: i suppose so
07:17 < dileep> syskk is here
07:17 < dileep> someoneweird is here
07:17 < dileep> rla is here
07:17 < dileep> ggoku22 is here
07:17 < dileep> need small help
07:44 < [AD]Turbo> hi there
08:04 < SoulRaven> anyone here use node-mysql module?
08:04 < SoulRaven> i don't know way on numbers, the number 0 in front of them is missing
08:04 < SoulRaven> even if in DB exists
08:29 < chovy> anyone use node-email-templates? I'm having trouble using <% include header %> inside html.ejs
08:35 < SoulRaven> way node-mysql module, cut the leading 0 number from any numbers?
08:44 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: are they numbers, or strings?
08:44 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: what column type?
08:46 < chovy> i am doing if ( err ) console.log(err); throw err;
08:46 < chovy> is the console.log necessary here?
08:46 < chovy> how else can i log the error?
08:47 < Pete2> console.error might make more sense for that
08:47 < Pete2> but it depends what you wnat to do with it
08:47 < gf3> Also you are always throwing the error
08:47 < chovy> gf3: if i throw the err, does it eventually get logged to console?
08:48 < gf3> You code is the equivalent of: if ( err ) { console.log(err); } throw err;
08:48 < chovy> gf3: yeah, i have the {} in the right place
08:48 < gf3> You have no {}
08:48 < chovy> i didn't type it correctly
08:49 < Pete2> the error will go to the cosole unless it is caught in a try catch
08:49 < chovy> i have if ( err ) { console.log(err); throw err }
08:49 < chovy> just wondering if i need console.log or not
08:49 < chovy> ok
08:49 < chovy> Thanks Pete2 
08:49 < Pete2> np
08:49 < Pete2> also you're app will quit unless the error is caught
08:50 < gf3> chovy: For future reference, these are the kinds of things you can test in mere seconds
08:50 < Pete2> that's why it depends on what you're trying to do
08:50 < sppericat> hello!
08:51 < chovy> what about item.save(function(err, item){}
08:51 < chovy> can i do if ( err ) next(err) there?
08:57 < SoulRaven> bigkevmcd: int(10)
08:57 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: do you mean int(010) ?
08:58 < SoulRaven> and in the db field i have something like: 0765756756 and node-myql return 765756756
08:58 < SoulRaven> mysql field type is int(10)
08:58 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: you're missing my point, the leading zero doesn't exist in the database
08:59 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: Are you storing numbers, or strings?
08:59 < SoulRaven> the attributes is UNSIGNED ZEROFILL
08:59 < SoulRaven> for this type of field
08:59 < SoulRaven> bigkevmcd: storing numbers
09:00 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: so, numbers don't have a leading zero, unless you display them that way
09:00 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: read the definition of ZEROFILL
09:01 < SoulRaven> and way in php i get that leading 0, without any modification, and in node i don't get that leading zero
09:01 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: it's for specifying the display width
09:02 < bigkevmcd> I'd say node-mysql is doing the right thing, and PHP is doing it wrong
09:02 < SoulRaven> so, exists any workar arround for that in node-mysql
09:03 < SoulRaven> to have leading zero when field attributes is unsigned zero fill
09:03 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: zerofill on output
09:04 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: there are lots of examples
09:04 < SoulRaven> where?
09:06 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: http://bit.ly/WIeMeP
09:08 < SoulRaven> bigkevmcd: thx, but my question whas regarding node-mysql, not for mysql
09:08 < SoulRaven> bigkevmcd: thx, but my question whas regarding node-mysql, not for javascript after work
09:08 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: zerofill on output
09:09 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: numbers don't have leading zeros, except for if you display them that way
09:09 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: just as you wrote int(10) instead of int(010) above
09:18 < SoulRaven> bigkevmcd: i know, but way php or another language knows that for display and query numbers without unsign zerrofill to use 0 leading or not
09:18 < SoulRaven> i quess that node-mysql don't use data from fields atrributes and dispplay and query the fields using that information
09:26 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: Zero-filling numbers is ambiguous at best, given that 0 is the common prefix for octal numbers, is 010 actually 10, or 8 ?
09:29 < SoulRaven> is hard to make a zero fill method after mysql query, because you don't know 2 things, 1 field attribute, 2 field length
09:30 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: Zerofilling is a display issue tho'
09:30 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: zerofill it to the number of places that makes sense when you're displaying the number
09:31 < SoulRaven> or because this is the number format
09:31 < SoulRaven> in my example, the fields represent the phone numbers
09:31 < SoulRaven> to 0 is a part of that number
09:31 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: phone numbers aren't numbers, they're strings
09:31 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: if you're not sure of that, try adding two phone numbers together, what do you get?
09:32 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: they might _look_ like numbers
09:32 < SoulRaven> string if you want to separate the numbers by points or something else
09:32 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: that's a fundamental data-modelling error
09:32 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: phone numbers are not numeric values
09:33 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: It makes no sense to AVG(phone_number) or SUM(phone_number) or do anything numeric with a phone number
09:33 < SoulRaven> so the phone numbers, is not a number, numbers are string
09:33 < SoulRaven> but i am not making operation with that numbers
09:34 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: so, why model them as numbers?
09:34 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: are you likely to do person.phone_number += 1 ?
09:34 < SoulRaven> because are numbers, a int number with 10 length
09:34 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: they're not numbers
09:34 < SoulRaven> way do someone make SUM of phone_numbers
09:35 < SoulRaven> what will be the reason for that
09:35 < whitman> SoulRaven, what happens when you get international numbers, or numbers with extensions +447... ext 1234?
09:35 < bigkevmcd> or longer than 10 digits?
09:36 < MelkorNemesis> SoulRaven: noone would do that .. just like whitman says, what if there is an extension
09:36 < SoulRaven> will not be longer that 10, because is used for AVL devices
09:36 < MelkorNemesis> just make them strings, what's the problem?
09:37 < SoulRaven> if the phone number will be with extenstion, the extenstion for that country or county will be presend in the country or county table
09:38 < dileep> chovy,how could i embedd css file into ma code.
09:39 < SoulRaven> way to hardcode a phone number in that specific example, when i all ready have a relation link between tables
09:39 < dileep> how could i include my css code into node.js simple form making style
09:40 < SoulRaven> another example with leading zero's numbers is when you have to store prices, number 2 in the field represents 2euro, but 020 represents 20 cents
09:41 < SoulRaven> so leading zero is important
09:41 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: you're modelling is flawed
09:41 < bigkevmcd> s/you're/your/
09:41 < whitman> SoulRaven, in that case you would store it as cents
09:41 < whitman> so 20 = 20cents, 220 = 2 euro 20 cents
09:42 < wires> SoulRaven: you know the case where a nurse was charged for killing someone?
09:42 < SoulRaven> and 10 cents as 010 
09:42 < whitman> SoulRaven, no, 10 cents is 10
09:42 < wires> The doctor usually said give 0.1 cc of this and than. Then the doctor said .10 can killed the patient
09:44 < SoulRaven> so, the all other languages are mistaken when display the leading 0 of a number, when the unsign zerofill is set
09:44 < SoulRaven> in that case what is the role of unsign zerofill atribute, if ther has no proprose
09:45 < wires> s/can/and/
09:45 < case_> SoulRaven, in all the languages I now leadin 0 means octal...
09:45 < SoulRaven> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5256469/what-is-the-benefit-of-zerofill-in-mysql
09:46 < SoulRaven> in that thread, zipcodes are another example of zerofill unsingn
09:47 < case_> I like the "It's a feature for disturbed personalities who like square boxes." answer :)
09:48 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: Personally, I wouldn't use it, the caveat about UNION queries would be enough to make realise that it's a bad idea
09:49 < bigkevmcd> SoulRaven: and despite what that StackOverflow query would indicate, zipcodes are not numbers either
09:50 < syskk>   if (msg && (msg.toString instanceof 'function')) {
09:50 < syskk>                  ^
09:50 < syskk> TypeError: Expecting a function in instanceof check, but got function toString() { [native code] }
09:50 < syskk> anyone knows how I should be doing that
09:50 < SomeoneWeird> huh
09:50 < SomeoneWeird> oh, hm
09:50 < bigkevmcd> syskk: toString()
09:51 < SomeoneWeird> no bigkevmcd 
09:51 < bigkevmcd> oh
09:51 < syskk> bigkevmcd: weird..
09:51 < SomeoneWeird> you want to check it has a toString function right
09:51 < syskk> SomeoneWeird: right
09:51 < syskk> seems to work in node's console
09:52 < case_> typeof(msg.toString) == "function" ?
09:52 < bigkevmcd> ^^^ that's the right use
09:52 < syskk> ahhh damn it
09:52 < syskk> lollll
09:52 < syskk> i was using instanceof with a string
09:53 < bigkevmcd> I tend to use: typeof msg.toString === "function"
09:53 < syskk> getting tired..
09:53 < SomeoneWeird> if(msg && msg.toString && {}.toString.call(msg.toString) == "[object Function]") {
09:53 < SomeoneWeird> will work better ^
09:53 < syskk> fail
09:53 < SomeoneWeird> ?
09:53 < case_> the kind of lines of code that make me hate JS :)
09:53 < syskk> referring to me
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> heh
09:54 < AAA_awright> case_: typeof isn't a function, that should be (typeof msg.toString)
09:54 < syskk> {}.toString.call(msg.toString) >> isnt this calling msg.toString.toString() ?
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> nop
09:54 < case_> AAA_awright, ok thanks.
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> > {}.toString.call(''.toString)
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> '[object Function]'
09:54 < AAA_awright> syskk: Not necessarially, if msg.toString is defined as a property
09:55 < SomeoneWeird> >> {}.toString.call(''.toString)
09:55 < purr> SomeoneWeird: SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
09:55 < SomeoneWeird> lol
09:55 < AAA_awright> And why are we calling toString on a function?
09:56 < AAA_awright> syskk: (msg && (typeof msg.toString)=='function') is sufficent
10:32 < NodeX> anyone ever used node to stream data to a shoutcast server?
10:32 < NodeX> I see on github some people have streamed from a server but not to one
10:58 < jwulf> anyone used jasmine to test a function that returns its result via async callback?
10:58 < jwulf> can't get it to work
11:04 < bigkevmcd> jwulf: yes
11:05 < bigkevmcd> jwulf: presumably you're using jasmine-node ?
11:05 < syskk> mmm connect.staticCache() is deprecated? what should i use to cache my files..
11:06 < bigkevmcd> jwulf: if so, for function function myFunction(callback) { ... callback(result) } ; you need it("should call my callback with the result", function (done) { myfunction(function (result) { expect(result).toBe(...); done(); });
11:07 < syskk> ah, they recommend varnish
11:08 < aandy> hi, for session storage any k/v db would be ok i guess. i have a cassandra cluster and a (very) small mongo db. i see a lot of people using redis aswel. any one had a practical comparison of either of them (or just one) with many concurrent sessions? like, how many would you estimate redis/mongo could handle before scaling further? i'd think millions per instance, but just wanted to ask in case someone already has experience with this :) otherwise i'll run
11:10 < SomeoneWeird> redis will win for non-persistant storage
11:11 < sargodarya> aandy it really depends on the machine and the amount of RAM you have
11:12 < aandy> you're right. i was just thinking ballpark, say 2-4gb decent cpu (i5-i7)
11:12 < SomeoneWeird> redis will still win for pretty much any config
11:12 < chrismatheson> Hi, a newbie ish question, but the forever module, thats not reall an alternative to linking into rc scripts ?
11:13 < SomeoneWeird> aandy, http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis
11:13 < aandy> SomeoneWeird: non-persistant as in, server crash -> all sessions reset?
11:13 < aandy> ah, d'oh, thanks
11:13 < sargodarya> nice link SomeoneWeird
11:13 < aandy> yup
11:13 < chrismatheson> as if forever can start / stop / monitor node process but something needs to start forever. So i will still need to use linux rc / system V / whatever scripts to start a forever process ??
11:13 < SomeoneWeird> well yeah, but if you're server crashes you've got a bigger problem that maintaining sessions ;)
11:13 < sargodarya> xD
11:13 < SomeoneWeird> than*
11:14 < SomeoneWeird> your*
11:14 < SomeoneWeird> fuck i can't grammar tonight
11:14 < sargodarya> SomeoneWeird: at least it's only the grammar.
11:14 < aandy> well, i still do replication, but yeah :)
11:15 < aandy> i guess sessions aren't the thing users are most worried about when aws has hours of outage one day
11:15 < aandy> hehe
11:15 < jwulf> bigkevmcd, you're a bloody legend mate
11:15 < jwulf> why the heck isn't that in any of the examples?
11:15 < jwulf> seems like a pretty common use case to me, at least in node dev / testing
11:15 < bigkevmcd> jwulf: it is...
11:16 < bigkevmcd> jwulf: first example in the README.md
11:23 < jwulf> really?

11:42 < darthdeus> hey guys, what do you recommend for learning how to write good node code?
11:43 < AAA_awright> Anything for writing good ECMAScript code
11:43 < darthdeus> AAA_awright: I'm quite ok with writing client side JS, mostly angularJS atm, but node is just impossible for me :\
11:43 < AAA_awright> http://wtfjs.com/
11:43 < darthdeus> it's mostly the package managemnt and testing
11:44 < darthdeus> AAA_awright: I meant something more advanced, like how to handle nested callbacks, how to organize stuff so that it is testable etc ... my basic JS is ok
11:44 < AAA_awright> There's no testing libraries that make me bubble over with joy but Vows is good enough... And package management is just a clustercuss
11:44 < darthdeus> clustercuss? :P
11:44 < substack> https://gist.github.com/3945605 is my favorite
11:45 < AAA_awright> darthdeus: Nested callbacks? pfft... Common sense, hard thinking?
11:46 < darthdeus> any books?
11:47 < AAA_awright> Also http://callbackhell.com/
11:47 < AAA_awright> Utilize those named functions
11:48 < AAA_awright> And yeah, http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clustercuss
11:50 < artem_> Hello there ac anyone help me?
11:50 < AAA_awright> JUST ASK THE QUESTION
11:50 < AAA_awright> I mean, what's the problem
11:51  * AAA_awright gone
11:51 < artem_> I want to install nodejs on production Ubuntu Server and I need to khow how should I set it up to be secure?
11:52 < SomeoneWeird> well, that's up to your code
11:52 < AAA_awright> Security isn't about the one thing you're supposed to do, it's about the ten hundred thousand things you're not supposed to do, and if you do any of them it's as good as if you failed at all of them
11:52 < artem_> I mean what directory should I use foe my nodejs files and what permissions should I set
11:53 < artem_> Is there best tuttorial for installing nodejs on Ubuntu?
11:54 < AAA_awright> Just a normal user, and run some load-balancer to call them up
11:54  * AAA_awright really really away
11:54 < SomeoneWeird> https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
11:55 < artem_> thanks. And the last question how to set load ngix and load balancer for  nodejs?
11:56  * hemanth_ is suffering from bloggers block....:\
11:57 < syskk> what's the best way to check if a file exists and is writable?
11:57 < SomeoneWeird> fs.exists?
11:58 < SomeoneWeird> & fs.stat (i think) to get perms
11:59 < syskk> fs.open('file', 'w', cb) maybe
11:59 < syskk> ok
12:00 < syskk> SomeoneWeird: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats nothing about permissions here:(
12:03 < aandy> SomeoneWeird: thanks again for the link. i made the decision to go with redis for sessions in my case :)
12:15 < rgb247> hello there, I need someone that can help me to understand how things works
12:16 < rgb247> for example, I have a http web server with node js
12:16 < rgb247> with a client connected to it
12:16 < rgb247> I want the server to tell to all connected clients when someone else has been connected
12:18 < hemanth_> rgb247, check out socket.io
12:20 < maplesoft> can two browsers send message to each other without the involvment of a webserver?
12:28 < thomaschaaf> I am trying to build the debian package from http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/nodejs.git  does anyone know if there is any activity?
12:29 < christophsturm> how can i fix a gyp based native project for node 0.9.2? https://gist.github.com/f47a2e209cf02edaff2a 
12:30 < hemanth_> maplesoft, nope, but you can try using something like pusher
12:31 < hemanth_> thomaschaaf, some at #debian would be knowing the best?
12:32 < hemanth_> christophsturm, microtime_module?
12:32 < hemanth_> not found>
12:32 < rgb247> hemanth_: what are the difference between node js and socket.io
12:32 < rgb247> I use node js for creating a web sockets web server and socket.io for interaction between socketS?
12:33 < christophsturm> hemanth_: this module works on node 0.8, and I wonder why it does not in 0.9
12:33 < hemanth_> rgb247, /socket.io/socket.io.js
12:34 < hemanth_> christophsturm, strange, you have both the versions installed ? 
12:34 < maplesoft> hemanth_:  is it possible by pusher?
12:34 < christophsturm> I'm just wondering if there are any changes with native modules in 0.9 that cause this
12:36 < hemanth_> maplesoft, it avoids you to code a server, read http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html
12:36 < maplesoft> hemanth_:  what is  pusher ?
12:38 < hemanth_> maplesoft, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=pusher
12:38 < aandy> not that kind of pusher
12:38 < aandy> ..or is it
12:39 < hemanth_> aandy, heh heh 
12:39 < hemanth_> http://pusher.com/
12:44 < symeog> what is the minimum reading i have to go through in order to get started with node ?
12:46 < hemanth_> symeog, well if you are aware with javascript and event loops it will be very easy to get started with node docs
12:46 < aandy> http://callbackhell.com/
12:46 < hemanth_> oh yeah :P
12:47 < hemanth_> use named functions 
12:47 < maplesoft> hemanth_:  pusher is a server ..
12:47 < symeog> no hemanth_ i am not aware…do u have any links of good and if possible small readings ?
12:48 < hemanth_> symeog, their docs are the best, http://h3manth.com/content/blocking-vs-non-blocking-nodejs had written this sometime back 
12:48 < hemanth_> maplesoft, hmm
12:49 < wltsmrz> JavaScript Garden is pretty good http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/
12:49 < hemanth_> maplesoft, what are you trying to do
12:49 < hemanth_> wltsmrz++
12:49 < julrich> hi everyone, are there any known workarounds for paths, with regards to npm, that are too long in windows?
12:50 < symeog> thanks guys i m gonna check them out now!
12:50 < maplesoft> hemanth_:  tryig to somehow send message from one browser to another
12:50 < maplesoft> without the involvment of a third webserver
12:51 < hemanth_> but why?
12:52 < hemanth_> maplesoft, you did not read http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/ ?
12:52 < hemanth_> maplesoft, if both the browsers on the same domain you can do http://www.h3manth.com/content/cross-window-messaging
12:56 < symeog> does node.js imply the creation of the so called 'single page applications' ?
12:56 < wltsmrz> Not at all
12:57 < hemanth_> symeog, if you need that look into backbone
12:58 < [emil]> hi
12:58 < symeog> no no no non non no no on the contrary!!!!! thats why i am asking !!!
13:00 < wltsmrz> The answer is "No." Node doesn't say anything about the number of pages you should serve.
13:00 < wltsmrz> In fact it doesn't say anything about web applications at all.
13:00 < symeog> after all i am not a front end developer myself and all i need to clarify here is that node is not only suitable for front end developers
13:00 < MI6> joyent/libuv: Ben Noordhuis master * b7f38b1 : Revert "unix: avoid iterating over all async handles"  This reverts commi - http://git.io/n8We_A
13:00 < hemanth_> node is a server!
13:01 < symeog> right!!! that was my next question: is node only for web development ?
13:01 < hemanth_> no
13:01 < wltsmrz> Nope.
13:01 < symeog> so u can have clients other than a web browser right ?
13:01 < wltsmrz> TCP servers, UDP servers, whatever you like.
13:01 < wltsmrz> People have written IRC servers in node.
13:01 < symeog> can u even serve ison or xml data ?
13:02 < wltsmrz> With ease.
13:02 < symeog> great!1!
13:02 < hemanth_> symeog, https://github.com/hemanth/irc-notify 
13:02 < hemanth_> an example for irc
13:02 < bnoordhuis> symeog: node is for writing chat apps
13:03 < symeog> so i guess communicating with non document databases is easy too right ? i mean oracle/sql server/mysql/postgress....
13:03 < hemanth_> symeog, yes, there are wrappers
13:03 < clever> hemanth_: i had to write a wrapper for the wrapper!
13:04 < symeog> ok because i am interested in database centric apps atm
13:04 < clever> mysql-native doesnt handle disconnects on its own, so i added auto-reconnect
13:04 < hemanth_> clever, kool :)
13:04 < clever> hemanth_: its as simple as db_conn.socket.on('close',...
13:05 < clever> in my case, i just set a flag to mark it as dead, and the doQuery wrapper checks and reconnects
13:05 < symeog> the reason that node version is 0.8.12 implies that is still in beta ?
13:06 < wltsmrz> As opposed to 1.x.x?
13:06 < symeog> yes
13:06 < hemanth_> clever, simple stuff are most used 
13:06 < wltsmrz> I think the idea is that 1.x.x will be fully API-stable.
13:06 < symeog> what does that mean exactly ?
13:07 < wltsmrz> Though the changes lately have been minor and easy to accommodate if you pay a lick of attention.
13:07 < wltsmrz> For example, path.exists became fs.exists.
13:07 < symeog> ok…got it !!
13:07 < symeog> and this one won't bother me i guess…i am a latecomer anyways
13:08 < wltsmrz> isaacs is very diplomatic about "legacy" support.
13:08 < symeog> first of all though i have to go through this mdn tutorial…don't u think ? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide
13:09 < wltsmrz> Yes, I endorse that idea.
13:09 < symeog> ok...
13:11 < symeog> any good editors on mac ?
13:11 < zonetti> symeog, subilime-text 2 :)
13:12 < jipiboily> I second that, love sublime text 2
13:12 < symeog> i have that guys…any special configuration i need ?
13:12 < jipiboily> you can also check for Textmate…version has been opensourced, you can compile it yourself (or maybe there are binaries somewhere)
13:12 < zonetti> symeog, jipiboily, https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/
13:12 < zonetti> thank me later :)
13:12 < jipiboily> saw that one, on my read list
13:12 < jipiboily> :)
13:13 < symeog> hmm it seems very nice link!!!
13:14 < symeog> i also have both text mates 1.5 and 2
13:14 < symeog> i also have BBEdit, emacs, vim
13:14 < wltsmrz> Vim or bust.
13:15 < symeog> ok we have another contester here i guess !!!
13:15 < panosru> Hello, I know that with io.sockets.socket(socket.id) I can send a message to specific user, but is it possible to send a message to all rooms for that user only? For instance if the user is connected to 4 rooms I need to send a message to that user to all 4 rooms he is connected to.
13:15 < zonetti> symeog, I have never used text mate, but the guy who made these videos did... text mate, vim... and ended up with sublime :)
13:15 < symeog> hmmm ok then…sublime it is
13:16 < jipiboily> I used textmate for a couple of years, waited for V2, v2 sucked (maybe fixed now) performance-wise mostly, Sublime is the best for me now
13:16 < zonetti> symeog, listen to his arguments, then see for yourself :)
13:16 < wltsmrz> I would actually recommend ST2 considering all that you have on your plate.
13:16 < wltsmrz> Vim is kind of something you have to learn.
13:17 < jipiboily> agree
13:17 < symeog> i ll use sublime guys…at least for starters
13:18 < symeog> and should i begein with project or simple files ?
13:18 < symeog> i can't figure out how to save a project…strange
13:19 < jipiboily> I personally don't use projects, maybe I should…but I don't
13:19 < symeog> oh ok …so i guess is not that big of a deal
13:19 < jipiboily> just open a directory
13:20 < jipiboily> maybe, but if you that article, maybe they'll say you should and say why
13:20 < jipiboily> good luck and have fun!
13:20 <@Nexxy> thesteve0, \o/ awesome :D thanks for sharing your work :)
13:20 < symeog> yeah thanks:) i ll read the article too and sorry for this editor thing spam

13:27 < julrich> no devs using windows here? surely i'm not the only one having encountered problems with deeply nested npm-dependencies and the maximum path length, or am i?
13:28 <@Nexxy> julrich, that's a new one on me, but I don't use windows :<
13:28 < julrich> fortunately don't use windows either, but we'll have to support devs using windows with a current project. and this crept up, and i don't find anything related to this
13:29 < aandy> julrich: i sometimes use node on windows, but haven't had the problem you mention
13:29 < julrich> hm, okay
13:31 < aandy> julrich: how nested is .. nested?
13:31 < julrich> let me see, but apparently it is _too_ nested ;)
13:37 < julrich> "./node_modules/grunt-requirejs/node_modules/grunt/node_modules/gzip-js/node_modules/deflate-js/js/node_modules/bean/support/smoosh/examples/config_json" which in itself accounts for 150 chars already, system limit in windows seems to be 260
13:37 < aandy> uh... *why* do you have it like that?
13:37 < aandy> you should have them all in your ./node_modules, not nested
13:37 <@Nexxy> lol
13:38 <@Nexxy> modules that you require have their own node_modules
13:38 <@Nexxy> and they have their own
13:38 <@Nexxy> and so on
13:38 < aandy> right, but in that case he might consider globalling some of them :)
13:38 < julrich> globalling? nah
13:38 < julrich> this has to be self-contained, and shouldn't rely on global modules
13:39 < julrich> i mean, it's probably an edge-case

13:51 < majestic8> How long does it take to broadcast a simple event (no additional data) to a 1000 clients over socket.io?
13:55 < majestic8> How long does it take to broadcast a simple event (no additional data) to a 1000 clients over socket.io?
13:55 < bradleymeck> majestic8: that depends on a ton of things: latency, MTU, network load, packet loss, ...
13:55 < majestic8> Assuming ideal conditions?
13:55 < bradleymeck> 0s
13:56 < majestic8> Point. My mistake.
13:56 < bradleymeck> majestic8: I would not worry about such a small number of clients
13:56 < majestic8> 1000 is small? I read somewhere that 3000 was the upper limit ... above that the latency was unacceptable.
13:57 < bradleymeck> majestic8: depends on setup, for a single box using long polling 3000 is probably pretty high up there
13:57 < bradleymeck> for a distributed system like voxer, they deal with lots more
13:58 < bradleymeck> though i think they moved to a lower level now
13:59 < majestic8> But I can be assured that 1000 client won't be a problem, right?
13:59 < majestic8> My application will 
14:00 < majestic8> most probably never exceed that number.
14:04 < bradleymeck> majestic8: you can never be 100% on things
14:17 < joehoyle> Hey, I am doing mutlipart uploads to S3, whereby I have a buffer, on data received add to the buffer, then if the buffer is over 5MB upload it, reset the buffer string and continue. However, the download is a lot quicker than the upload, so I get ~10 uploading buffers at once, and I am getting a socket hang up issue (presumably because I have lots of connections to s3)
14:17 < joehoyle> Would it be better to only upload one buffer at a time, and pause the strem in until upload has finished?
14:18 < bradleymeck> joehoyle: i would force a limit on number of connections, look at something like async.queue or kue
14:19 < joehoyle> bradleymeck: ahh ok cool, so my implemnation of just send off a new upload part as soon as the data comes in is sound, just need to push it to a queue

14:19 < dschatz> Hi, I'm trying to develop a nodejs addon in c++. Is there any explanation of the interaction of a c++ addon in the context of multiple child processes? It's my understanding that these are actually separate OS processes and so shared memory is not valid, but what about init? Is it called per child process or just once?
14:20 < ashnur> anyone has advice on how to authenticate dnode calls?
14:20 < bradleymeck> dschatz: it is called when the module is loaded and not already in the require.cache so once per child
14:20 < dschatz> and how do people typically communicate between c++ addons in different processes? Setup a socket or is there some accepted interface?
14:21 < bradleymeck> 0mq
14:21 < bradleymeck> dschatz: basically any sore of message bus, socket or otherwise
14:21 < ashnur> zero m q? :)
14:22 < dschatz> Is there a special initialization for the first process to init the addon to setup the communication? I guess what I'm asking is how do I know about the other child processes from within my addon
14:23 < bradleymeck> dschatz: there are just too many ways to do that to reply easily, i would recommend using 0mq or an existing solution that takes care of that for you
14:24 < jhernandez> RLa: JFYI, I moved to node-gyp and now it works
14:24 < RLa> hey
14:25 < RLa> good to hear you got it working
14:25 < ashnur> so? dnode auth? :-S
14:25 < jhernandez> so, thanks for your help!
14:25 < jhernandez> :]
14:25 < RLa> btw, i think at some time a mail was sent to each module author who still used waf
14:26 < jpw> Hey, I'm having a problem getting my head around asynchronous requests when you need the callback data before you can continue. Could someone help me with this little nugget... http://pastebin.com/gtfTqBL8
14:26 < substack> ashnur: auth : function (secret, cb) {}
14:26 < substack> cb(someThings)
14:26 < ashnur> wtf
14:26 < ashnur> ah
14:27 < RLa> jpw, you need to do it all through callbacks
14:28 < RLa> there is no "waiting" or "blocking"
14:28 < RLa> oh, and you need async loop too
14:29 < jpw> So in essence - never use the return statement?
14:29 < jpw> RLa, and what's an async loop?
14:29 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
14:29 < RLa> next iteration will start when old ones completes asynchronously
14:30 < RLa> basically it unrolls the loop into a chain of callbacks
14:30 < niggler> how does node handle errors?  when i make a custom error, the toString doesn't print the object's message
14:31 < RLa> you inherit Error?
14:31 < bradleymeck> niggler: same as JS look at flatiron's err module https://github.com/flatiron/errs for examples on extending
14:31 < niggler> >>> function MyError(message) { this.name = "MyError"; this.message = message || "Default Message"; } MyError.prototype = new Error(); MyError.prototype.constructor = MyError; throw new MyError()
14:31 < purr> niggler: MyError: Default Message
14:32 < niggler> now try that in the node CLI and in chrome
14:32 < niggler> chrome says the right thing
14:32 < RLa> what if you inherit Error
14:32 < niggler> node just says "Error"
14:32 < niggler> using util.inherits?>
14:32 < RLa> duh
14:32 < RLa> depends what style of inheriting you prefer
14:33 < niggler> that works
14:33 < RLa> not sure but maybe node check instanceof Error
14:33 < plato> hmm
14:33 < RLa> or some specific property on it
14:33 < niggler> but why should node do something different from other v8 instances (namely chrome) in this case
14:33 < RLa> niggler, i think there was a tutorial on errors in node, you will want proper stacktrace too
14:33 < plato> where does npm install -g install stuff to?
14:33 < plato> it's not in my path
14:34 < symeog> correct me if i am wrong: node web apps are freed from dealing with AJAX/jQuery for sending and receiving data from the server. like PHP for example.
14:34 < RLa> plato, here as root, it puts them under /usr/local/lib/node/node_modules i think
14:34 < bradleymeck> plato: node's install prefix +lib/node/node_modules
14:35 < bradleymeck> on windows its in AppData
14:35 < wltsmrz> Node has nothing to say about web applications, symeog.
14:35 < wltsmrz> Not how many pages those applications might have, or how bidirectional communication might be had.
14:35 < RLa> symeog, node runs on the server side
14:35 < wltsmrz> Node is a server platform.
14:35 < RLa> symeog, tho you can use ajax and even jquery if you like
14:36 < symeog> after i have seen the basic create server example of hello world i just come to this conclusion
14:36 < plato> which node gives me /usr/bin/node
14:37 < plato> i do have a /usr/local/lib/node_modules/express/bin folder containing the express executable
14:37 < RLa> plato, check with stat if it's a symlink
14:37 < RLa> and where it points
14:37 < symeog> every communication between client and node server is asynchronous right ? it doesn't block any interface….
14:37 < RLa> yes
14:37 < wltsmrz> Yes, symeog
14:37 < bnoordhuis> RLa, plato: fs.readlink()
14:37 < plato> nope, regular file RLa
14:37 < bnoordhuis> oh wait, read fail
14:38 < RLa> yeah, it's easier to use command line utility stat
14:38 < plato> bnoordhuis: i'm just trying to make my npm install -g stuff available in my path :D
14:38 < RLa> when you're in shell
14:38 < plato> ideally, without adding each and every program individually
14:38 < RLa> i think that was changed, you cannot use those modules anymore
14:38 < symeog> plato: ls -al /usr/local/bin/npm start from there
14:39 < bradleymeck> plato: -g will not be available in local repositories for a lot of good reasons and many blog posts blah blah
14:39 < plato> symeog: i have a /usr/local/bin/express but no /usr/local/bin/npm
14:39 < bnoordhuis> plato: i have $HOME/bin on my PATH and symlink things from $HOME/opt/node/lib/node_modules
14:39 < bradleymeck> if you are using this for propagating dev modules look at npm link instead
14:39 < symeog> plato: try this too ls -al /usr/local/bin/express
14:39 < plato> AH that's it i think
14:39 < symeog> plato: strange !!!
14:40 < aandy> hey bradleymeck, thanks for the tip last night. i went with something very similar to what you said, keeping ip aswel - although i'm not sure when i'll invalidate it (country change, isp subnet, ..) :)
14:41 < plato> LOL ok weird /usr/local/bin is indeed in my path... its just my tab completion that seems screwed up
14:41 < symeog> :plato also try to reinstall nom and express with the -g command…actually if ur on a mac its pretty easy…just download the latest .dmg and install it over what u have now!
14:42 < symeog> plato: NO…try to put this path the first path of your path
14:43 < symeog> plato: like PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
14:43 < symeog> plato: in ur .bash_profile
14:44 < harrydog> in express, a "routes" folder is setup, and require("./routes") is called, but what does it do?
14:44 < joehoyle> if I get "throw arguments[1]; // Unhandled 'error' event" anyway I can actually track down from what that is coing from?
14:45 < harrydog> nevermind, loads all the routes to be called
14:52 < symeog> does javascript and/or node have string interpolation ? i.e. "User name is #{username}"
14:53 < bradleymeck> symeog: look at underscore
14:53 < symeog> is it a node module ?
14:53 < bradleymeck> npm module
14:53 < harrydog> does require("./routes") automatically look for an index.js?
14:53 < parallel> you might try util.format on node, which is built in.
14:54 < parallel> just %s printf formatting though.
14:54 < symeog> thanks parallel but then again what is underscore exactly ? same as jade or els ?
14:54 < symeog> ejs*
14:55 < wltsmrz> Yes, harrydog.
14:55 < wltsmrz> It will look for a routes.js or routes.json, or a routes/index.js
14:55 < parallel> symeog, underscore's a utility library for Node and Javascript. lots of utilities here: http://underscorejs.org/
14:57 < symeog> aha..this one is a big lib ray i get it…but i still need to know something else too
14:57 < symeog> if instead of a hello world i would like just to serve a static page…..
14:58 < symeog> how would i access a variable from inside my html ?
14:59 < wltsmrz> You can replace patterns within strings, symeog.
14:59 < parallel> you'll have to use a templating engine in that case.
14:59 < symeog> lets just say i want to print the current date time instead of a hello world but from inside html tag
15:00 < symeog> are patterns and templates the same thing ? can u give me a link ?
15:00 < wltsmrz> You don't _have_ to use a templating engine.
15:00 < symeog> wltsmrz: so how can i do it ?
15:01 < wltsmrz> One moment, symeog.
15:01 < symeog> yes take ur time pls
15:02 <@konobi> symeog: ejs, jade, handlebars..s lots of libraries
15:05 < generalissimo> i have a question about require paths: i have /config and /models/user, and models needs to load the config
15:05 < generalissimo> i know that require('../config') will work, but i don't like defining my require statement relative to the file
15:06 < generalissimo> i'd rather define it relative to the root of my project
15:06 <@konobi> generalissimo: it's relative to the module
15:06 < symeog> konobi: as far as i understand, if i want to create a web application in node i have to use mvc framework express right ? are those libraries compatible with express ? is indeed express the only stable and simple mvc framework out there ?
15:06 <@konobi> generalissimo: check the Module docs
15:06 < generalissimo> i'm checking them
15:06 < bradleymeck> generalissimo: when passing configuration to modules, wrap it in a function and pass as args
15:06 <@konobi> symeog: you don't have to use express
15:07 < bradleymeck> don't hard code your config to a value or it will be terrible to mock
15:07 < parallel> generalissimo: another option is the global object.
15:07 < generalissimo> bradleymeck: i've thought about that. i've also thought about doing parent.module.whatever.
15:07 < bradleymeck> fragile
15:07 < generalissimo> right
15:07 < generalissimo> maybe global's the way to go...
15:07 < symeog> konobi: can you suggest the tools of the trade for a beginner like me ?
15:07 <@konobi> bah, reminds me that i need to fix my 'mocked' module
15:08 <@konobi> symeog: HTTP =0)
15:08 < wltsmrz> Something like this, symeog, https://raw.github.com/gist/2f12b724798a5fa9bffb/bfff1d77f69851b4e6130f7f2e8ee21e6e2d118a/gistfile1.txt
15:08 < symeog> u kinda lost me here :)
15:08 < harrydog> do i have to call res.end() after res.render()  in express
15:08 < shanse> no
15:09 < symeog> thanks for the trouble wltsmrz i am looking at it now :)
15:10 < wltsmrz> There is no shortage of templating libraries.
15:10 < niggler> is there a template language that looks like php?
15:11 <@konobi> symeog: what i mean, is it's all just text
15:11 < joehoyle> Hey, I am bashing my head against a wall trying to find out where this "// Unhandled 'error' event" error is coming from, I have .on( 'error' ) for all my http requests, but I am not sure what else requires a .on(), is it possible to get a stack trace to find out where that error is comding from?
15:11 < generalissimo> niggler: it's called php
15:11 < generalissimo> :p
15:11 < TheEmpath> niggler: I made one for node.js
15:11 < niggler> that's what I'm looking for TheEmpath :)
15:11 < TheEmpath> niggler: it scans an HTML doc for a <tag> with javascript code in it, then runs it
15:11 < TheEmpath> however, its not meant to be ran per page request
15:11 < niggler> i have a shitton of php scripts
15:11 < TheEmpath> its designed only for cached/static pages
15:12 < niggler> and they don't use php advanced features
15:12 < niggler> its just like for($i=0; $i != 10; ++$i) 
15:12 < TheEmpath> i should say it runs the JS between the tag upon page request, replaces it with an output, then caches it
15:12 < niggler> and i wonder if there's a translator or a way to use them directly
15:13 < TheEmpath> i should also mention that my page is mostly an application with an init stage and a "main loop"
15:13 < TheEmpath> so the page loads, assets are called, then data is dynamically pushed down to it from the server
15:13 < generalissimo> niggler: you could probably write one as long as you had javascript equivalents for every php function
15:14 < generalissimo> but that sounds dicey
15:17 < bradleymeck> joehoyle: use domains
15:17 < joehoyle> bradleymeck: sorry, I am not sure what that means
15:18 < bradleymeck> joehoyle: http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html
15:18 < joehoyle> bradleymeck: ahh thanks!
15:20 < dschatz> How would a c++ addon identify that it belongs to a particular execution of node (from within a child_process perhaps)? Is there any identifier I can use from any child process?
15:21 < bradleymeck> dschatz, belongs means…? pid , ppid?
15:22 < dschatz> bradleymeck: I run my node application twice, and this application spawns many child_processes, how would I identify which of the two applications a child_process belongs to
15:22 < MI6> joyent/libuv: piscisaureus created branch reftest - http://git.io/fF9FRQ
15:23 < bradleymeck> dschatz, ppid
15:23 < ashnur> i am stupid
15:23 < ashnur> :(
15:23 < dschatz> bradleymeck: thanks
15:25 < dschatz> Is there a way to determine from a c++ addon if it executes on a child process?
15:26 < bradleymeck> dschatz: standard ways to test as any other c++ thing
15:26 < nuba> hi folks, I'm running into a DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT error, this is my own self-signed snake oil cert, I'd rather enable a ignore flag somewhere, any pointers?
15:27 < dschatz> bradleymeck: I mean in the context of node's child_process module. I can check the parent of a process but any process would have a parent
15:27 <@konobi> bradleymeck: well, ppid may be set for both parent and child
15:28 <@konobi> dschatz: you could always set an env var
15:28 < bradleymeck> dschatz: konobi: check against a ppid equaling a different pid can pass it however, stdin, env, argv ...
15:29 < bradleymeck> argv or stdin probably sanest since they wont cascade
15:30 < dschatz> konobi bradleymeck: all those require the javascript to invoke child_process in a particular way though right? Now if someone wants to use my module they must change potentially unrelated code
15:31 < dschatz> perhaps simplest is to just see if ppid is a binary named node, but thats a bit flaky too
15:31 < bradleymeck> dschatz: if you are interacting with an executable that depends on the parent module, it should just act like any other cli app
15:31 < bradleymeck> doing magic === edge cases
15:31 < bradleymeck> dschatz: make your module have a wrapper for cli if you are paranoid
15:33 < dschatz> bradleymeck: I want to create a shm mapping for all processes in the node application to communicate (in my addon), but I need to know that they all belong (including the original process)
15:34 < dschatz> I rather not expose that to javascript if I dont have to
15:34 < harrydog> how do i check in express, if a file exists before i "sendfile()" it?
15:34 <@konobi> dschatz: why not use a library that handles that for you
15:35 <@konobi> harrydog: same way as you do in any other app
15:35 < shanse> harrydog: that's nothing express specific http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
15:35 < superjoe> harrydog, if you're using middleware, you can add another middleware after the static file middleware
15:35 < superjoe> and the second one won't get called if the file is missing
15:35 < superjoe> err
15:35 < superjoe> the second one will *only* get called if the file is missing
15:36 < dschatz> konobi: 1. Because I need pretty fine grained control over communication, I'm a researcher trying to integrate my c++ programming model and make it accessible within nodejs. 2. Because I'm a hacker
15:41 < harrydog> like this is my app.get function http://pastie.org/5109636
15:41 < wockan> hello
15:42 <@konobi> dschatz: from c++ you could do setsid and getsid
15:43 < bradleymeck> isaacs: how long will npm support 0.6.x?
15:46 < dschatz> konobi: thanks
15:46 < harrydog> think i figured it out, fs.exists() then an simple if/else
15:48 < FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here use Sublime Text 2 to write NodeJS code?  I'm hoping to find a way to do code completion ( including on installed modules via npm in the local directory )
15:51 < bradgignac> FunnyLookinHat: you probably should look at exuberant ctags of jsctags
15:51 < FunnyLookinHat> bradgignac, Oh ok cool thx!
16:05 < dmactough> SublimeText/CTags
16:09 < FunnyLookinHat> dmactough, do I have to change my default settings for SublimeText/CTags at all?  Or just rebuild and go ?
16:10 < dmactough> FunnyLookinHat: Just found it myself this moment. Looking for the same answers. :) 
16:10 < FunnyLookinHat> dmactough, haha
16:10 < FunnyLookinHat> yeah rebuilding...  taking a while because it's doing my entire ~/source/ directory
16:10 < FunnyLookinHat> lots of stuff in there ;
16:13 < FunnyLookinHat> ah shoot - and I have TWO copies of LibBoost in there to index too....   >_<
16:14 < apmacwrk> pwd
16:15 < niggler> apmacwrk: /
16:15 < apmacwrk> sorry
16:17 < FunnyLookinHat> dmactough, Yup - it works!  You just have to install a ctags lib and rebuild.
16:23 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.9.3-release * 1ed4c67 : 2012.10.24, Version 0.9.3 (Unstable)  * V8: Upgrade to 3.13.7.4  * crypto (+1 more commits) - http://git.io/kw1Zeg
16:24 <@isaacs> bradleymeck: i have no plans to kill it
16:24 <@isaacs> bradleymeck: but i don't test on it any more.
16:24 < dmactough> FunnyLookinHat: sweet. rebuilding.
16:24 <@isaacs> bradleymeck: so it's really just a question of whether or not people will complain :)
16:24 < bradleymeck> just wondering since i saw customFds still in there
16:24 <@isaacs> bradleymeck: oh, customFds is still supported.
16:25 <@isaacs> bradleymeck: in node, i mean
16:25 <@isaacs> bradleymeck: it's just not the "good" way to do it
16:25 <@isaacs> { stdio: 'inherit' } is way more clear than { customFds: [0,1,2] }
16:27 < Hoverbear> Anyone here using Node.js on a Raspberry Pi? Could I get a review at all?
16:32 < FunnyLookinHat> Hoverbear, just googled "nodejs raspberry pi" -> https://gist.github.com/3301813  :)
16:32 < joehoyle> Hoverbear: I installed it, no issues so far, there is also a module for interfacing with th GPIO pins for node
16:32 < FunnyLookinHat> It'll run slow - but should work.
16:33 < Hoverbear> joehoyle: Yes I saw that https://github.com/EnotionZ/GpiO
16:33 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: Yeah, that's my concern.
16:33 < joehoyle> Hoverbear: dont do any of the patching, node 0.8.10 just compiles fine striaght off
16:33 < joehoyle> Hoverbear: took about 4 hours to compile
16:33 < FunnyLookinHat> Hoverbear, well... if you want real ARM performance get a real board like a Beagle or something.  :)
16:33 < Hoverbear> joehoyle: 0.8.11 apparently works great too and only about 2 hour compile.
16:33 < joehoyle> Hoverbear: ahh sweet!
16:33 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: The Pi is faster then a Beagle I though
16:33 < FunnyLookinHat> No!
16:34 < Hoverbear> joehoyle: This is derps on the forums so they might be lieing
16:34 < FunnyLookinHat> Well depends on the board you get - but there are plenty of boards that are faster... they'll obviously not be as cheap though.
16:34 < joehoyle> Hoverbear: hehe fair enough
16:34 < FunnyLookinHat> Also - if you can get an ARMv7 SoC you'll probably find things a bit easier to work with in the long run ( including being able to use things like Ubuntu and it's PPAs )
16:36 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: ARM v7 SOC?
16:36 < Hoverbear> I'm not familiar with SoC
16:36 < analphabet> Hoverbear: so sorry to hear that
16:36 < FunnyLookinHat> Hoverbear, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3310907/what-are-the-advantages-of-armv7-over-armv6-when-compiling-iphone-apps
16:36 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: So floating point?
16:37 < FunnyLookinHat> Hoverbear, that's the big advantage in the spec - but the larger scheme is that more linux distributions are building for ARMv7 rather than v6 - so you'll find it easier to build and use software on it.
16:37 < FunnyLookinHat> You can build a lot of stuff from source though - like NodeJS - it's just a PITA and slow as hell.
16:37 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: Ah. And the Pi doesn't have ARM v7?
16:37 < FunnyLookinHat> Nope, v6
16:38 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: Well in theory I could use a VM to build on one of my more powerful machines
16:38 < FunnyLookinHat> The RPi is an AWESOME device - don't get me wrong... I love mine... it's just that you get what you pay for  :)
16:38 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: Yeah, I'm looking for a low cost node.js platform with GPIO
16:38 < FunnyLookinHat> Hoverbear, then RPi is it!
16:38 < Hoverbear> Yer
16:38 <@konobi> it didn't take me too long to compile node on RPi
16:39 < FunnyLookinHat> You can always buy a few and just cluster them...
16:39 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: Was considering doing that.
16:39 <@konobi> especially now that it's a 512Mb version
16:39 < Hoverbear> Yeah
16:40 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat, konobi: So overall thoughts? Is it nice to work with?
16:40 < airtanah_> will 'npm publish' package symlinks?
16:43 < syskk> good question
16:43 < syskk> you can try and npm publish -f  again if it didnt work
16:45 < FunnyLookinHat> Hoverbear, I mean - it's nice, sure... easy enough to get up and running.  It'll chug a bit, but for very menial tasks it works well.  As long as you're not running X ( i.e. headless ) it does really well for what it comes with
16:45 < FunnyLookinHat> Hoverbear, And if you order one NOW - with the 512 MB memory instead of 256 - it'll work even better.
16:45 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: Yeah I will definitely not be using X
16:45 < Hoverbear> FunnyLookinHat: It's just gonna be like, core with ssh, node (+deps) and mongoDB
16:46 < prateekp> hello
16:47 < prateekp> i m getting an error Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP
16:47 < prateekp> what to do
16:47 < prateekp> i am using d3.js library
16:47 < prateekp> has anybody encountered this problem before
16:47 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus__] by ChanServ
16:47 < DaMorpheuS> hey guys I've a question about node.js + riak
16:47 < Hoverbear> prateekp: That sounds like browser side issue
16:48 < prateekp> what should i do then Hoverbear
16:48 < qbit> was someone working on a despotify <-> node thing? 
16:48 < Hoverbear> prateekp: What browser?
16:48 < prateekp> chrome
16:48 < Hoverbear> prateekp: Is the page being served by node.js?
16:49 < prateekp> no
16:49 < prateekp> its just a html page 
16:49 < Hoverbear> prateekp: Then the node.js channel is probably not a good place… However, Chrome will give that warning on pages accessed via file://
16:49 < DaMorpheuS> someone?
16:49 < Hoverbear> prateekp: So you can either host it somewhere (like node.js), or launch chrome with the appropriate flag to disable those warnings (Google it)
16:50 < Hoverbear> DaMorpheuS: Never heard of Riak :(
16:50 < DaMorpheuS> uhmm to bad
16:50 < DaMorpheuS> is db
16:51 < Hoverbear> DaMorpheuS: Yes I googled it.
16:51 < CoverSlide> it's the five bajillionth nosql db out there
16:51 < CoverSlide> and just like the rest, it's the best one out there
16:51 < CoverSlide> DaMorpheuS: just ask your question
16:51 < Hoverbear> CoverSlide: I'll stick to mongo/mongoose
16:52 < qbit> nm : https://github.com/antidau/node-despotify 
16:52 < CoverSlide> if they know, someone will answer
16:52 < CoverSlide> Hoverbear: because it's web scale?
16:53 < Hoverbear> CoverSlide: Because it doesn't get in the way (yet)
16:54 < CoverSlide> that's what all nosql db's say
16:56 < airtanah_> syskk i published twice and no luck with symlinks - perhaps because windows has messed up support for them?
16:56 < Hoverbear> CoverSlide: I'm not saying it's good/best/anything…. It's just easy as cake for me to use (Probably since it;s the first DB I used)
16:56 < syskk> airtanah_: maybe you could try hard linking?
16:56 < CoverSlide> kew
16:56 < syskk> maybe
16:57 < airtanah_> syskk i am linking directories tho
16:57 < syskk> maybe isaacs could help you
16:57 < syskk> if he's around
16:58 < airtanah_> i am packaging a pre-compiled module that collects V8 cg data, and i have the compiled modules separated by os/arch/version, many versions are cross-compatible so i have symlinked them
16:58 < airtanah_> i can always move that logic into the application 
16:59 < AAA_awright> airtanah_: What are you doing with symlinks?
16:59 < AAA_awright> Windows doesn't really have "symlinks" it has "shortcuts"
17:00 < airtanah_> link darwin/x64/v0.8.12 -> darwin/x64/v0.8.11 etc
17:00 < airtanah_> i don't really NEED symlinks to work, i can always just have nodejs calculate the right path
17:03 < prateekp> hoverbear: but why is this problem coming ....
17:03 < Hoverbear> prateekp: So that people can't hack your shit.
17:03 < prateekp> if run it in firefox then also same issue is coming
17:03 < Hoverbear> prateekp: You realize if you googled this issue the first result tells you how to fix it right?
17:03 < sivang> hi all
17:04 < prateekp> hoverbear: i am not able to fix it .... i am confused 
17:04 < sivang> I'm looking for a ready made seach engine (if can be, with natural language processing) to match make between a someone who needs a work done, and a person that is the most suitable for the job according to data he entered both free from and text fields
17:04 < Hoverbear> prateekp: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=chrome+cross+domain+origin+policy&l=1
17:04 < sivang> does anybody know if something like this existing that can be molded to one's needs?
17:08 < prateekp> hoverbear: i read http://joshuamcginnis.com/2011/02/28/how-to-disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome/ .... but thats for windows .... what to do in ubuntu
17:08 < Hoverbear> prateekp: Launch chrome however you do but with the given options.
17:09 < Hoverbear> prateekp: Presiumably it's in your path, so in a terminal just type `chrome <the options it says>`
17:09 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs created tag v0.9.3 - http://git.io/e2V7mg
17:09 < jrowny> You can modify all the shortcuts in ubuntu, I did that when setting up Sublime
17:10 < jrowny> I think it's in /usr/share/applications
17:10 < jrowny> and then juts modify the Exec="" command for chrome
17:10 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.8 * 82a72e9 : blog: Post for v0.9.3 release - http://git.io/xcZAvA
17:10 < Hoverbear> jrowny: It'd be silly to change that permanently given that those security settings are there for a very good reason
17:11 < jrowny> I was just suggesting an alternative to the blog he posted's solution, which was to modify the shortcut
17:11 < jrowny> this is the same thing only in Ubuntu
17:11 < prateekp> hoverbear: chrome command does not launch chrome 
17:11 < jrowny> btw, you could create another shortcut using this method and name it something like... "dev"
17:12 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs master * 9b3f635 : Merge branch 'v0.9.3-release' (+2 more commits) - http://git.io/g_OMOQ
17:12 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs master * 78dbb15 : Now working on v0.9.4 - http://git.io/sOraeg
17:12 < jrowny> just copy the chrome or chromium file in /usr/share/applications and change the name and the exec. Give it a different icon if you're feeling frisky.
17:14 < jrowny> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Howtos/DesktopFiles here's a wiki about it
17:20 < nezZario> any docs / papers on the security track record for node.js ?
17:21 < nezZario> ah crap .. brb
17:23 < nezZario> anywho, about the security .. :)
17:24 < tnorris> nezZario: you looking for stuff like this: http://www.websecuritywatch.com/cve-2012-2330-nodejs/
17:26 < tnorris> actually, is anyone aware of a specific commit msg key that shows a commit for a security fix?
17:34 <@isaacs> tnorris: yeah, gimme a sec i can dig somethingup
17:34 <@isaacs> tnorris: there was a http security fix a while back, i think
17:34 <@isaacs> tnorris: 7b3fb22
17:34 <@isaacs> tnorris: the commit message was intentionally vague until it was included in a release.
17:35 < tnorris> isaacs: ah, that makes sense.
17:35 <@isaacs> tnorris: there was a blog post about it
17:36 <@isaacs> http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/05/07/http-server-security-vulnerability-please-upgrade-to-0-6-17/
17:36 <@isaacs> tnorris, nezZario ^
17:36 < airtanah_> i gave up on packagin symlinks in npm, i moved the logic into the application
17:37 <@isaacs> of course, long since fixed in 0.8
17:37 < tnorris> isaacs: awesome, thanks. seems like node security has been relatively solid. you think that's from its architecture, or because of size of enterprise usage?
17:37 <@isaacs> airtanah_: "packaging symlinks in npm"?
17:37 < airtanah_> isaacs does npm support packaging symlinks?
17:37 < airtanah_> we were wondering that earlier
17:37 <@isaacs> airtanah_: i'm not sure what that means.
17:37 <@isaacs> airtanah_: i mean, no, it will not ever include a symbolic link in a package tarball, if that's what you mean.
17:37 <@isaacs> airtanah_: they're not portable.
17:38 < airtanah_> yes
17:38 < airtanah_> i figured
17:38 < airtanah_> since windows dosen't seem to support it
17:38 < airtanah_> it wasn't a game stopper, i just added the logic to the application
17:38 <@isaacs> airtanah_: but if you have a linked package in node_modules, and it's on the bundledDependencies list, then it'll resolve it into node_modules as a normal file in the tarball.
17:38 < Absolute0> How do people normally run socket.io alongside their webapp? How can one make ajax requests to the socket.io app with it being served from a different server? Isn't their that single origin issue to deal with?
17:38 <@isaacs> airtanah_: windows supports them, sorta, but it's different in subtle ways
17:39 < Absolute0> *there
17:39 < lowtax> when does everyone get op again
17:39 <@isaacs> tnorris: the arch is pretty good, i think.  i mean, there's not much that's new in node.
17:39 <@isaacs> tnorris: the approaches we take are all pretty well-proven
17:39 < airtanah_> isaacs i explored the world of  windows symlink for a bit, it was 'subtle' for sure
17:39 < bradgignac> Absolute0: you'll want to serve the socket.io js from the same host as the socket.io server
17:39 < lowtax> is nodeconf over
17:39 < tnorris> nezZario: so it looks like all security related patches are posted to http://blog.nodejs.org/vulnerability/. funny enough, there's only one post.
17:39 < Absolute0> bradgignac: so the port doesn't violate the single origin policy?
17:40 < Absolute0> bradgignac: a different port that is.
17:40 < CoverSlide> isaacs: any movement on peerDependencies?
17:40 < aandy> Absolute0: note that servering from same host (and port) can also be done by proxying
17:40 < aandy> yes, port violates too. at least it should in most browsers
17:40 < bradgignac> Absolute0: it does
17:40 < `3rdEden> Why does readableStream.pipe not stop with sending data when the destStream is closed?
17:40 < airtanah_> isaacs thanks
17:40 < analphabet> goodness, i can't read anything in here....
17:40 <@isaacs> CoverSlide: i don't think so
17:40 < bradgignac> you don't server socket.js from your webapp js
17:41 < Absolute0> so what's the general practice in having something like nginx and socket.io work together?
17:41 < bradgignac> serve it from your socket.io server
17:41 < aandy> if there's no way to serve through same host:port then considering setting up the cross-origin-policy to fit your needs
17:41 <@Nexxy> \o/
17:42 < Absolute0> aandy: how do you proxy to the same port/hostname? ssh -L ?
17:42 < dschatz> Why is it that if I do a cluster.fork and then write to console.log on all workers (including the parent), the application doesn't die?
17:42 < CoverSlide> Nexxy: vov ??
17:42 < nezZario> so it looks like 1 relatively major security issue has been discovered in all of recent node.js existance? =)
17:42 < CoverSlide> i don't know what shrugging should be
17:42 < aandy> well, you could do that. i use a reverse proxy, like haproxy - or pound. i think nginx can be hacked to do it, but it's not built for it (http 1.0, not 1.1)
17:43 < bradgignac> aandy: +1
17:43 < tnorris> isaacs: cool. i remember trying to convince where I worked to take node seriously in early 2010. awesome to watch it evolve.
17:43 <@Nexxy> CoverSlide, lolwat
17:43 <@Nexxy> oh lol
17:43 <@Nexxy> <o>
17:43 < nezZario> that's pretty darn secure imho ..
17:43 < aandy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4360221/haproxy-websocket-disconnection/4737648#4737648 here's a working config (for haproxy)
17:44 < CoverSlide> nginx can handle https, haproxy nasomuch?
17:44 < aandy> haproxy handles https fine (in my experience)
17:44 < CoverSlide> oh
17:44 <@isaacs> tnorris: INORITE!?
17:44 < aandy> added ssl support some time ago, not sure exactly when
17:44 < CoverSlide> hmm i thought i read somewhere you have to use stunnel
17:44 < CoverSlide> oh ok
17:44 < nezZario> nginx has https
17:44 <@isaacs> tnorris: our tls performance is still not fantastic.
17:44 <@konobi> it was recent iirc
17:44 <@konobi> or was that pound... hhhmmm...
17:45 < aandy> right, it didn't use to support https. in fact it used to have no intend to support it
17:45 < analphabet> I HAVE A QUESTION: Does node run on linux?
17:45 < dschatz> if I change a hello world application to use cluster.fork and do hello world in parallel why doesn't the process die?
17:45 < aandy> i think it changed when stunnel mimicked the haproxy config layout, but i could be wrong
17:45 < CoverSlide> analphabet: no, only windows and amigaosx
17:45 < CoverSlide> s/x//
17:45 < nezZario> stunnel is pretty decent too btw
17:45 <@konobi> aandy: http://haproxy.1wt.eu/
17:45 <@konobi> top news item
17:46 < analphabet> CoverSlide: It doesn't run on linux then?
17:47 < CoverSlide> anyone else find haproxy's git repo take forever to cline?
17:47 < analphabet> node I mean...
17:47 < mynodey> not sure if this is the best place to ask native node questions, but I always get a "Trap abort" problem when I call pthread_mutex_lock in the thread pool, even if the mutex is my own.  anyone know why this might be?  also, if i call fs.readFileSync() beforehand in node, it also causes some weird locking issues
17:47 < CoverSlide> analphabet: yes it runs on linux
17:48 < analphabet> CoverSlide: someone said it wouldn't....
17:48 < tnorris> isaacs: the asm ssl changes by piscisaureus__ recently should have helped that, right?
17:48 <@konobi> analphabet: you'd be hard pressed to find a place it doesn't run
17:48 < CoverSlide> linux is one of the main target platforms
17:48 < dschatz> can anyone explain (or point me at docs) explaining what causes a cluster to stay alive if there are no event listeners?
17:48 < tnorris>  /ssl/crypto/
17:48 < aandy> CoverSlide: http://blog.exceliance.fr/2012/09/10/how-to-get-ssl-with-haproxy-getting-rid-of-stunnel-stud-nginx-or-pound/ has basic sni filtering, cipher selection, batch loading of certs. my use case wasn't too elaborate so not sure exactly how it compares to nginx, but performance on https requests were fast in my tests
17:48 < CoverSlide> konobi: MIPS+NetBSD ?
17:49 <@isaacs> tnorris: yes, they help
17:49 <@konobi> mips, sure... but that's a platform, not an OS
17:49 <@isaacs> tnorris: but we're still not as fast as nginx
17:49 < nezZario> actually i'm curious if it runs well on netbsd since my security questions earlier were if I ported some python (i hate python .. sorry if that offends you .. but i just can't stand the syntax) to node.js
17:49 <@isaacs> nezZario: node might run on netbsd
17:50 <@isaacs> nezZario: but it's not an os we test on regularly
17:50 < nezZario> .. the python runs on a bunch of netbsd servers that are vps host machines
17:50 <@isaacs> nezZario: it runs well on darwin
17:50 <@isaacs> nezZario: and that's pretty close in most ways
17:50 < CoverSlide> isaacs: GNU/Darwin?
17:50 <@isaacs> CoverSlide: hahaha
17:50 <@isaacs> CoverSlide: well... OSX/Darwin
17:52 < `3rdEden> node -e "require('fs').createReadStream('/dev/random')" # Why does this leak memory
17:52 < `3rdEden> there are no references that points to the data 
17:53 < airtanah_> generall, do peopl prefer binding node directly to port 80, or do you use a proxy?
17:53 < tnorris> isaacs: fast as nginx? that would be impressive. I humbly bow to the skills that can make that happen.
17:53 < `3rdEden> memory keeps growing, never goes down..
17:53 < lz> `3rdEden, does that continuously stream
17:53 < airtanah_> i prefer using a proxy, and always starting my applications in user space, vs. dropping privileges
17:53 < `3rdEden> lz:  yes
17:53 < aandy> airtanah_: personally using a proxy - or routing
17:53 < `3rdEden> lz: it's just streaming data, to nothing
17:54 < CoverSlide> I'd love gnu/darwin to get more adoption. Would be nice to have a free server with binary compatibility with people's osx machines
17:54 < airtanah_> aandy which proxy do you use?
17:54 < nezZario> why do you all use proxies so adamently ?
17:54 < aandy> haproxy/nginx depending on the case
17:55 < nezZario> just load balancing or is there some other something I'm missing here?
17:55 < Hoverbear> CoverSlide: I agree
17:55 < lz> `3rdEden, weird, maybe it starts buffering the continuous stream until it runs out of memory?
17:55 < tnorris> `3rdEden: what OS you using, I'm not showing memory leak.
17:55 < `3rdEden> Mac
17:55 < aandy> nezZario: load balancing, but also routing and combining services, and delegating requests
17:56 < tnorris> `3rdEden: hm, not happening on Ubuntu. just holding steady at 7mb.
17:56 < `3rdEden> tnorris: dafuq
17:56 < airtanah_> nezZario its also about which application binds to the privileged port
17:56 < airtanah_> i use nginx, and i KNOW it will not f* up my machine when running in sudo
17:56 <@isaacs> tnorris: yes, that's what we should aim for.
17:56 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
17:56 < airtanah_> and it drops privileges properly
17:56 <@isaacs> tnorris: we can use more memory, that's fine.
17:56 <@isaacs> tnorris: but we should go as fast.
17:56 < airtanah_> nezZario i would rather run my app from user space to begin with
17:57 < tnorris> `3rdEden: ah, needed to change it to this: node -e "require('fs').createReadStream('/dev/urandom')"
17:57 < `3rdEden> ah :p
17:57 < tnorris> `3rdEden: now I'm showing continuous memory growth. i'm going to let it run for a while and see what happens.
17:57 < nezZario> ahh gatcha
17:57 < nezZario> you go through that much trouble to ensure node.js isn't running as root?
17:57 < nezZario> can it not drop privs after binding?
17:57 < clock>  node -e "console.log('Hello World');" # terminates                node -e "var cluster = require('cluster'); if (cluster.isMaster) { cluster.fork(); } console.log('Hello World');" # doesn't terminate            why is that?
17:58 <@isaacs> clock: it's kinda weird to fork the -e arg
17:58 <@isaacs> clock: i'm not sure if that'd work like you want it to
17:58 < tnorris> `3rdEden: here's the fastest growth function, but still leveling at ~178MB: node -e "require('fs').createReadStream('/dev/zero')"
17:59 < clock> isaacs: sorry I just mean to show a script I run, if I use cluster.fork and there are no more eventlisteners it still doesn't terminate
17:59 < airtanah_> aandy: any proxies that support websockets?
17:59 < `3rdEden> tnorris: I do see some small garbage collection here and there, but it's still odd that it keeps growing
17:59 < aandy> haproxy does, and i think pound aswel
17:59 < clock> isaacs: doesn't matter if I put that in a file and run it or execute it via command line
17:59 < aandy> if you consider varnishd a proxy, that too
17:59 < tnorris> `3rdEden: what's the largest memory usage you're showing?
17:59 <@isaacs> clock: ok
17:59 <@isaacs> clock: try on master?
18:00 <@isaacs> clock: i think it's becasue the IPC channel isn't unref'ed
18:00 <@isaacs> clock: so you have a socket open between the child and parent.
18:00 < clock> isaacs: Thats what I figured, how do I close that?
18:00 <@konobi> `3rdEden: you don't have anything reading from the stream?
18:00 < nezZario> delete cluster; ?
18:01 < clarle> Hm, I'm really new to writing native extensions for node, and I'm having a hard time keeping track of the V8 syntax. Any autocompletes out there for vim/emacs for v8?
18:01 < `3rdEden> konobi: nope, nothing
18:01 < nezZario> just a shot in the dark: node -e "var cluster = require('cluster'); if (cluster.isMaster) { cluster.fork(); } console.log('Hello World'); if(!cluster.isMaster) delete cluster; "
18:01 <@isaacs> clock: here's the comit that fixes that in 0.9.3 (just released) https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/212466b
18:02 <@isaacs> nezZario: that's not what delete does.
18:02 <@konobi> `3rdEden: so you're filling up a backlog =0)
18:02 < nezZario> ahh ok, well i'm new at javascript in a running process ;)
18:02 < clock> isaacs: oh very cool
18:02 < clock> isaacs: thanks a lot
18:02 <@isaacs> clock: np
18:02 -!- Topic for #Node.js: Nodes JS ;
18:02 -!- Topic set by Nexxy [~emily@unaffiliated/nexxy] [Mon Oct 22 22:13:32 2012]
18:02 < `3rdEden> konobi: and how large is this backlog? Infinite? 
18:03 < nezZario> it's configurable i'm sure
18:03 -!- isaacs changed the topic of #Node.js to: Node.js: The Taste of a New Generation ;;; // <-- just for style; does nothing.
18:03 <@konobi> `3rdEden: i'd assume at some point the stream should get paused due to back pressure, but that may be a bug
18:03 < newjonaslund> hi
18:04 < newjonaslund> what's the best admin/cms module to use with nodejs? any recommendation?
18:04 < `3rdEden> konobi: well there is nothing that can indicate a backpressure as it's not piped in to anything
18:06 < `3rdEden> konobi: also when I close that stream after a while, the memory doesn't get reclaimed
18:07 <@konobi> how are you closing?
18:07 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: I don't follow
18:08 < `3rdEden> konobi: https://gist.github.com/3947755
18:08 < newjonaslund> for managing content with different user levels – in a way similar to wordpress admin system, but lowered
18:08 < newjonaslund> lowerend
18:08 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/02/03/5-content-management-or-blog-publishing-systems-written-in-node-js/ Like these?
18:09 < newjonaslund> yeah
18:10 <@konobi> `3rdEden: --expose_gc and global.gc() after you destroy the stream
18:11 < newjonaslund> i mean, what do most people use when it comes to managing content with nodejs?
18:11 < `3rdEden> running
18:12 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: That's like asking what most people use as CMS with Python man
18:12 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: It doesn't make a whole lot of sense
18:12 < newjonaslund> hehe
18:12 < newjonaslund> true that
18:12 < newjonaslund> but then for example, with Python the go to place is Django
18:12 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: True.
18:12 < newjonaslund> so in a way i'm looking for the equivalent with nodejs
18:12 < `3rdEden> konobi: still retains way to much memory
18:12 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: Make one.
18:13 < newjonaslund> sure
18:13 < newjonaslund> why do you think i'm asking?
18:13 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: Presumably? Lazy
18:14 <@konobi> `3rdEden: and if you add an on('data') handler?
18:14 < newjonaslund> so yeh, build Django
18:14 < newjonaslund> great plan
18:14 < newjonaslund> trying to save time but not building from scratch
18:14 < Hoverbear> newjonaslund: What do you want though? Like a blog or something?
18:16 < newjonaslund> a simple admin ui with CRUD operations based on data structure 
18:17 < prateekp> hello
18:17 < analphabet> prateekp: howdy!
18:17 < prateekp> has anybody used d3.js
18:17 < prateekp> are there any problems using it without framework 
18:18 < Hoverbear> prateekp: Once again, d3.js (and your problem) aren't related to node.
18:18 < prateekp> hoverbear: please help me
18:18 < Hoverbear> prateekp: I have already. You can try #javascript and #html, etc for help as well.
18:18 < `3rdEden> konobi: running again
18:18 < prateekp> if i host my page onto node.js would the issue be solved
18:19 < Hoverbear> prateekp: What issue? The cross reference origin one you had before?
18:19 < prateekp> yes
18:19  * analphabet there're too many trolls in here
18:20 < Hoverbear> prateekp: If you hosted it anywhere it would be solved…. Or just used the launch options I already supplied you with.
18:20 < `3rdEden> konobi: memory still not dropping
18:20 < prateekp> no its not working with those options
18:20 < syskk> is there any way to get a graph of my branches with the CLI tool?
18:20 < syskk> ooops wrong chan
18:20 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: Why would you need to manage content with Node.js?
18:20 < Hoverbear> prateekp: You didn't close chrome before doing it.
18:21 < newjonaslund> AAA_awright: why not?
18:21 < analphabet> syskk: never mind
18:21 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: Maybe something else is better? What does Node.js uniquely offer?
18:21 < analphabet> syskk: #node.js will answer any question you throw at it, just wait
18:21 < AAA_awright> Or rather, what comparative advantage does it offer?
18:21 < invisib> I'm trying to figure out if I'm using NodeJS 32bit or 64bit. Anyone know a command for that?
18:21 < AAA_awright> syskk: analphabet is correct
18:22 < newjonaslund> AAA_awright: true, I just prefer working with nodejs over ruby so was looking for the rails version ;)
18:23 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: Also, http://magnode.org/
18:23 < AAA_awright> I'm looking for people to test-install
18:24 < newjonaslund> AAA_awright: it's your project?
18:24 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: My point is, I know why I use Node.js, but do other people? Or is it just something to do because you can? (Which is a perfectly reasonable reason as an experiment, sure)
18:24 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: Yeah
18:25 < newjonaslund> what's your reason for using node.js?
18:25 < invisib> How can I see what version of Node I'm using? node --version doesn't show if I'm using 32 or 64 bit
18:25 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: Evented programming, and it uses ECMAScript
18:25 < AAA_awright> I've got a whole rationalle written up, actually, http://magnode.org/doc/design
18:26 < timeturn> node; process;
18:26 < timeturn> I believe
18:26 < newjonaslund> sweet
18:26 < newjonaslund> production ready? 
18:26 < blazes816> only if the developer is
18:26 < AAA_awright> Well, that website runs it
18:26 < AAA_awright> And it'll host a basic blog pretty well
18:26 < generalissimo> any mongoose experts in the house?
18:27 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: If you have MongoDB installed you can get started in like 10 mins
18:27 < generalissimo> i want to know if i can basically query for an embedded document on a model that's already been fetched into memory
18:27 < prateekp> hoverbear: i launched chrome using the commands -- chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security  
18:27 < newjonaslund> Cool, does it have a logic for dealing with different content types for different user levels
18:27 < analphabet> I'm trying to figure out how to install ECMAScript node.js 32bit or 64bit Evented programming
18:28 < prateekp> but nothing is happening
18:28 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: Yep, check it out http://magnode.org/MongoDBJSONSchema
18:28 < AAA_awright> Content type definitions themselves are a content-type
18:29 < newjonaslund> Nice!
18:29 < tnorris> isaacs: you think those the majority of the optimization would occur in the js lib, the crypto src, or the openssl dep?
18:29 < AAA_awright> And there's usergroup-based permissions
18:29 < newjonaslund> Looks good, I'll check it out. How committed are you to the project? 
18:29 < AAA_awright> That's what I could probably work on next, it's a bit difficult to implement...
18:29 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: It's been in progress for a year or two
18:29 < newjonaslund> AAA_awright: Alright. 
18:30 < AAA_awright> I'm hoping it'll be Big, Web Big
18:30 < analphabet> I'm trying to figure out how to install ECMAScript node.js 32bit or 64bit whether Evented programming in the js lib, the crypto src, or the openssl is in progress?
18:31 < analphabet> OR do I need a contentType?
18:31 < AAA_awright> newjonaslund: If you wanna try it now I can step you through that, though the documentation should be mostly complete
18:32 < AAA_awright> analphabet: Uhhhhhhh what? Sorry that looks like a long string of buzzwords
18:32 < newjonaslund> Yeah, looks good. I'll have a go and annoy you if I run into problems. 
18:33 < prateekp> hoverbear: i launched chrome using the commands -- chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security  
18:33 < prateekp> but nothing is happening
18:33 < prateekp> hoverbear: i launched chrome using the commands -- chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security  
18:33 < prateekp> but nothing is happening
18:33 < Hoverbear> prateekp: Is chrome completely closed? You probably hav sit open
18:34 < prateekp> shal i restart my computer
18:34 < analphabet> AAA_awright: I'm trying to figure out how to install ECMAScript in node.js 32bit or 64bit weather Evented programming is completely closed in the js lib, the crypto src, or the openssl is in progress? but nothing is happening!
18:34 < analphabet> AAA_awright: You probably hav sit open
18:35 < ikkedee> Just make sure no chrome processes are still running..
18:35 < AAA_awright> analphabet: my big data once crashed and the shards started throwing 404 errors, I'm not sure what causes that, sorry :(
18:35 < analphabet> AAA_awright: And I though the documentation was mostly complete....
18:36 < joaojeronimo> when the garbage collector in v8 runs, does it free the memory cleared or does it keep the memory for future needs ?
18:36 < analphabet> btw, i prefer using a proxy, and always starting my applications in user space, vs. dropping privileges. Feels better
18:37 <@konobi> `3rdEden: not sure off hand
18:37 < `3rdEden> konobi: logging it as bug for now
18:38 < analphabet> joaojeronimo: there was a http security fix a while back, i think
18:39 < joaojeronimo> analphabet, did you meant to send that to me ?
18:39 < analphabet> I've got a whole rationalle written up, actually, http://magnode.org/doc/design
18:39 < s5fs> wtf is analphabet a bot? seems like pure gibberish
18:40 < cpsubrian> Is there any way to have one globally installed module effect another?  The use case is a log-parsing CLI that I'd like to allow other modules to add formatters to.
18:40 < joaojeronimo> s5fs, yeah...
18:40 < s5fs> joaojeronimo: lame, who's bot is it?
18:40 < tnorris> isaacs: and you think the streams2 implementation will provide performance gains, or is it mainly for usability?
18:40 < Eansitor> why is the node http server slower than go?

18:44 < kingkaeru__> can anyone provide guidance on where i would find info on where npm.dir is pulled from?
18:44 < kingkaeru__> i have a line of code var npm = require("npm/lib/npm.js");
18:44 < kingkaeru__> and npm.dir is a path
18:44 < kingkaeru__> i'm trying to figure out how that is set
18:44 < prateekp> kingkaeru_ : u can find it for sure on google
18:44 < tnorris> Eansitor: broad question, and did you come to that conclusion by some benchmark? do share.
18:45 < kingkaeru__> ive tried googling but none of the keywords i try results in anything useful
18:45 < kingkaeru__> :/
18:45 < prateekp> chill ho ja yaha pe bhi kuch nahi milega tujhe

18:49 < ozten> I'm trying to write some tests which depend on express and being able to run in arbitrary evironments. 
18:50 < ozten> If I do var app = express.createServer();
18:50 < ozten> app.listen(0)
18:50 < ozten> I get a random port, which is awesome
18:50 < ozten> How can I figure out which port express ended up using?
18:50 <@konobi> ozten: or listen()
18:51 <@konobi> ozten: it'll be a property
18:51 < ozten> konobi: cool, I don't see a port number to use though
18:52 < nickmessing> Hello, someone can install ws module?
18:52 < nickmessing> I get error on that...
18:52 < tjholowaychuk> ozten .address().port
18:52 < ozten> tjholowaychuk, konobi: awesome, thanks!
18:53 < ozten> app.listen().address().port -> 54674
19:01 < Atticus> jaojeronimo: in the docs it says the garbage collector "reclaims memory". I would assume it adds it back to the stack.

19:06 < timeturner> W..T..F https://github.com/kripken/emscripten
19:08 < bradleymeck> timeturner yep, and it has actually been used quite well
19:09 < timeturner> what's the point of it?
19:09 < timeturner> I thought we were going from javascript to C++
19:09 < timeturner> or the general path
19:09 < timeturner> towards more effiiciency
19:09 < timeturner> not less lol
19:09 < timeturner> efficiency*
19:10 < jeffszusz_wrk> anyone familiar with the String.js library? the .truncate() method is documented but apparently doesn't exist and i'm wondering whether I'm just doing it wrong
19:10 < bradleymeck> timeturner : for some use cases C++ is slower than JS, read about node-mysql vs the original C++ parser
19:11 < bradleymeck> memory use is a lot lower with C++ generally though XD
19:11 < WarheadsSE> TooTallNate: oy!
19:11 < bradleymeck> TooTallNate: node-lame no likey 0.8.x on mac?
19:12 < TooTallNate> bradleymeck: you gotta use the "gyp" branch
19:12 < TooTallNate> WarheadsSE: yo!
19:12 < WarheadsSE> I'm always so busy elsewhere I forget to rejoin the channel :P
19:12 <@konobi> timeturner: imagine a cpu heavy algo that you want to do map-reduce stuff with that's in C... you can then distribute that via teh interwebs
19:13 < timeturner> ah
19:13 < timeturner> good point
19:13 < WarheadsSE> Got a question on methodology of doing this in node..
19:14 < walbert> timeturner: not to mention all of the code available right now that can be compiled directly to llvm bytecode - which emscripten could, with some elbow grease, allow you to run in a browser, client-side
19:14 < WarheadsSE> I have a namesake game, who's server is written in C++, that I am debating on moving to node, somewhat for exercise, somewhat for portability.
19:14 < EhevuTov> languages aren't fast; runtimes are
19:15 < WarheadsSE> It's essentially a very basic ASCII protocol akin to an IRC, but far less complex.
19:15 <@konobi> timeturner: transcoding in the browser... o.O
19:15 < bradleymeck> walbert: timeturner: it can compile and run linux with a little tweaking, was on slashdot a while back
19:15 < WarheadsSE> What might be the most appropriate method of handling switch/case/else mass statements in a parser?
19:16 < bradleymeck> TooTallNate++ nodeup playing in node
19:16 < TooTallNate> :)
19:17 < TooTallNate> bradleymeck: on OS X i take it?
19:17 < WarheadsSE> bradleymeck: right, wouldn't want to create any oopsy in too deep .. whoops :P
19:17 < bradleymeck> TooTallNate: yea, will try to see how windows deals with it tonight
19:17 < TooTallNate> bradleymeck: the build system needs work on other platforms currently, but all the code should already be in place
19:18 < bradleymeck> TooTallNate: figured
19:18 < TooTallNate> bradleymeck: patches welcome of course ;)
19:18 < lowtax> helo how to node
19:18 <@konobi> ERROR: invalid hostname
19:19 < mike-d> WarheadsSE: large switch, depends on the amount of work done in each pass, sounds like this might be a state machine / VM? 
19:19 < WarheadsSE> mike-d: mainly a state machine, yes, plus chat system protocol
19:20 < WarheadsSE> TooTallNate: including arm :P
19:21 < gbhatnag> hi all - what's the best way to do ajax file uploads in express 3 with formidable? tried using jquery fileupload widget, but it uses a standalone nodestatic server to handle uploads
19:21 < gbhatnag> we'd like to have the upload handled by our web server, not a separate file server
19:29 < vicapow> I wrote a module that uses another module (the canvas module in particular.) how can I make sure my module and project are using the same instance of the canvas module? is the best solution to just pass my projects "canvas" instance to the other module?

19:35 < CoverSlide> vicapow: maybe use exact version matching?
19:35 < vicapow> CoverSlide: you mean in the package.json file, specify the exact version?
19:35 < WarheadsSE> ^
19:36 < vicapow> CoverSlide: that would just ensure they're using the same version, not the same instance
19:36 < CoverSlide> hmm
19:36 < CoverSlide> well I think peerDependencies would solve your problem
19:37 < CoverSlide> but work's stopped on that 2 months ago
19:37 < WarheadsSE> oh, word missed

19:38 < CoverSlide> vicapow: you can do a symlink in your node_modules folders, but that requires you to manually modify the driectory structure
19:39 < CoverSlide> not that it's a bad thing, I just would do so with caution
19:39 < WarheadsSE> vicapow: are you meaning the same instance of the canvas module *object?
19:39 < vicapow> CoverSlide: seems gross. i wanted to publish my module for all to use :P
19:39 < CoverSlide> yeah, we'll have to wait for peerDependencies than
19:39 < CoverSlide> although .. not sure if that solves this problem as well ...
19:40 < vicapow> CoverSlide: yeah. i guess the only work around is to pass the canvas object to my module from the parent module
19:40 < vicapow> CoverSlide: i think it's the same issue
19:41 < vicapow> instead of returning an instance of my module, i'll have to return a function that takes the canvas object as an argument
19:42 < bradleymeck> TooTallNate: don't forget to add a .destroy to node-lame if you are doing stuff in there
19:48 < antidau> TooTallNate: hi there, got a question again: despotify's function to get an cover image returns a pointer to the image data, with the length determined by an output parameter. how do i access this?

20:15 < franco> someone has used the 'mysql' module ???
20:15 < vicapow> franco: yep
20:16 < Asm_Freak> Is it considered back practice to return a callback as a parameter to an event emitter `on` function? i.e....
20:17 < Asm_Freak> myEventEmitter.on('someNotification', function(done) { doLongFileProcess(done); });
20:17 < franco> i don't understand how to pass an array of data and, at the same time, get the number of affected files :s
20:17 < Asm_Freak> i.e. the `done` callback notifies the `myEventEmitter` when an operation has completed... is this bad practice?
20:17 < Asm_Freak> Shouldn't events on event emitter pretty much be a listen only sort of thing?
20:19 <@konobi> "i received data... here you go"
20:19 < franco> the docs explain how to get this number and the example uses the '?' character, but dont pass data :S

20:19 < fibo> hi all, I have a proposal for an npm feature. Is this the right place to talk about it?
20:20 <@mbalho> fibo: pull requests work pretty good
20:20 < fibo> I think npm sould add node_modules/.bin to its path so if you run "npm test" you can use bins from devDependecies
20:20 < fibo> hi mbalho, just want to talk about it before do a pull request

20:37 < aMoniker> Anyone have tips for managing scope within node modules?
20:37 < aMoniker> ending up with a lot of nested callbacks/closures
20:38 < DTrejo> aMoniker: i recommend naming your functions
20:38 < DTrejo> and then they dont nest
20:38 < DTrejo> because you can take them out and leave the names or whatever
20:38 < s5fs> Nexxy presenting right now?
20:39 < aMoniker> DTrejo: I have a closure with some variables, and then sub closures that start setIntervals, and in those intervals various functions can be called that need to modify the original variables I mentioned.

20:40 < DTrejo> aMoniker: http://sync.in/amoniker
20:40 < s5fs> oh goddammit, did i miss Nexxy? weak
20:40 < ashnur> i can has stupid question?
20:42 < s5fs> ashnur: just ask
20:42 < ashnur> what if I have a static site. an index.html, some style. nothing else. I imagined a setup where I would use passport browserid to login(or just browserid), then use dnode to change the site. but I am struggling with the concept
20:42 < chapel> name all the functions!
20:42 < chapel> DTrejo aMoniker
20:43 < DTrejo> :)
20:44 < ashnur> I would like to see if the client which makes the dnode call is authenticated (with browserid) or not. 
20:44 < ashnur> and I am not sure if this makes any sense to you 
20:48 < ashnur> not much, i assume, given the silence.. :(
20:49 < ashnur> see, that's why I ask first.
20:51 < DTrejo> i kinda get it
20:51 < DTrejo> but havent use browserid
20:51 < DTrejo> so noidea
20:53 < ashnur> DTrejo: well, it's not really about browserid. 
20:53 < bingomanatee> Good afternoon node
20:53 < ashnur> DTrejo: I guess it's the same with most passport strategies, or even with just connect.session
20:54 < ashnur> I know the session id of the client, but I have no idea how to check if that id is "live" on the server side
20:54 < DTrejo> doesnt it become live after browserid auth?
20:55 < DTrejo> dont they hit your server or something saying someone just auth'd/
20:55 < DTrejo> ?
20:55 < bingomanatee> ping creationix
20:55 < creationix> pong
20:56 < ashnur> DTrejo: yes, you are right
21:02 <@Nexxy> awe sorry s5fs 
21:03 <@Nexxy> othiym23, yeah I do. I'm looking into getting a commercial one
21:03 <@Nexxy> CoverSlide, thanks :)
21:09 < flybyme> im getting this error with mongoose https://gist.github.com/3948894
21:09 < flybyme> I have not idea why that error is showing up
21:10 <@konobi> Nexxy: hopefully not 220-240v this time
21:11 < flybyme> can someone give me a hand with that error?
21:12 <@konobi> flybyme: had a look at the code stated in the stacktrace?
21:14 < othiym23> Nexxy: you need whatever they used to have at Pine Street, with that weird sweet-smelling fog
21:14 < flybyme> @konobi> https://gist.github.com/3948919 this si the code that throws the error
21:14 < flybyme> i think i might have broken the db
21:18 <@konobi> othiym23: isn't that just a whole bunch of pot smokers?
21:18 <@konobi> flybyme: i mean by tracing back up through the stack to see where the "safe" property is being expected and the objct it
21:19 <@konobi> sit's supposed to be on is actually null
21:20 < flybyme> but if i did module.remove({},function(){})
21:20 < flybyme> it would throw the same error
21:23 < othiym23> konobi: no, there are different formulas for smoke machine smoke
21:23 < othiym23> time was when I spent a lot of time coddling smoke machines
21:26 <@Nexxy> othiym23, I read that it is mostly distilled water + glycol
21:26 <@Nexxy> and in differing ratios for how heavy you want it
21:39 < stevedomin> what is the best way to achieve a module system similar to the ruby one in node.js ?
21:39 < stevedomin> use global ?
21:41 <@isaacs> tnorris: i think it will not provide performance losses.
21:41 <@isaacs> tnorris: but yes, it's mostly for better utility
21:45 < TooTallNate> stevedomin: why would you want to do that?
21:45 < CoverSlide> can anyone tell me why we have readdir that reads a list of all the files? Wouldn't it be better if we had something that worked like c's dirent where 
21:45 < CoverSlide> we have a directory pointer and readdir that when we want to read the next file?
21:46 < CoverSlide> just out of curiosity
21:47 < stevedomin> TooTallNate: basically I would like to have a single point of entry to my package. Then I can use it like this : Module.A(), Module.B(). I can do this but I need to put all my class in a single file
21:47 < CoverSlide> I don't like the idea if I have a directory with a kajillion files that i have to wait till the whole list is read before i can do anything with it
21:48 < TooTallNate> CoverSlide: this has been brought up before… but i'm not entirely sure of the reasons (maybe portability?)
21:49 < CoverSlide> hmm
21:49 < CoverSlide> perhaps
21:49 < TooTallNate> stevedomin: why don't you separate your stuff into their own files, then require them into an "entry point" module?
21:50 < TooTallNate> stevedomin: like https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-lame/blob/gyp/index.js
21:53 < stevedomin> TooTallNate: yes that's what I'm trying. But I feel like I'm missing something, or maybe I'm trying too hard to apply a ruby paradigm to javascript
21:54 < TooTallNate> stevedomin: possibly :p what don't you like about the index.js file style?
21:55 < opus_> hey guys why does Node.js/Jade not have line returns in my HTML source? Everything is one line
21:57 < stevedomin> TooTallNate: I'm completely fine with it. What I'm trying to do with this package is creating a kind of "ruby module", with its own properties, methods, etc. and which also contains "class". These class can access properties and methods of the module, but also instantiate the other class of the module.
22:00 < NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOO> hey guys
22:01 < NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOO> everyone in @go-nuts is making fun of node
22:04 < brianc> TooTallNate: stevedomin: why don't you separate your stuff into their own files, then require them into an "entry point" module? <--- this
22:05 < TooTallNate> opus_: probably cause the HTML parser doesn't care about whitespace
22:05 < TooTallNate> opus_: but iirc, jade has a "pretty" output option
22:06 < opus_> oh thank you so much TooT
22:09 < stevedomin> brianc: I know, but I didn't manage to make it works like I want yet. Thanks for your help however. At least I know it's possible now.
22:14 < opus_> Hmm... pretty option doesn't have any affect

22:21 < p_l_a_y> ChrisPartridge: any ideas
22:21 < ryanrolds_w> Haha, I'm really surprised the YC app has a LOC question on it.
22:23 < tnorris> can I just take a moment to say, it is so stupid that innerHTML is faster than using the standard DOM methods.
22:24 < ChrisPartridge> p_l_a_y: as per the github page, try running "npm install mysql@2.0.0-alpha3" if you haven't already
22:25 < p_l_a_y> thats what I tried
22:25 < ChrisPartridge> node version?
22:26 < p_l_a_y> whats the command for version again
22:26 < ChrisPartridge> node -v
22:26 < p_l_a_y> 0.8.12

22:28 < HeilTec> Trying to connect using mIRC - getting connection refused ... /server rowling.freenode.net
22:28 < p_l_a_y> ok thx
22:29 < HeilTec> Any sugestions to why it fails?
22:34 < tnorris> isaacs: cool. was just perusing the tls source, and trying to identify where the biggest performance gains could be had. saw use of streams, and was wondering if the new streams2 interface would have provided a performance boost.

23:09 < huangjs> hey, anybody using passport? i need to merge twitter and facebook accounts when user sign-in, but in the callback of strategy, there's no req object that I can get the sessions. any idea?
23:11 < huangjs> the only solution i can come up with is to serialize everything in session and use success callback to do the merge. totally bizarre 
23:22 < Monkey_b> hey guys, is there somethign that i can use to escape command line arguments that im passing into a node script ?
23:22 < Monkey_b> e.g. nodejs foo.bar 'this is my friends' script'
23:23 < Monkey_b> i'd like to escape the single quote after friends'
23:24 < airtanah> \
23:24 < airtanah> \'
23:25 <@konobi> airtanah: use double quotes around your string
23:25 <@konobi> um.. Monkey_b even
23:25 < airtanah> or that
23:25 < Monkey_b> what if a doublequote gets passed in the argument?
23:25 < airtanah> oh you're right, i was totally wrong
23:26 <@konobi> Monkey_b: then handle it as stdin input
23:27 < othiym23> substack should totally make Browserify T-shirts
23:27 < othiym23> I just had this brilliant idea
23:27 < airtanah> Monkey_b generally only pass command line arguments that you yourself generate, don't accept user input
23:27 < othiym23> he doesn't have to pay me for it or anything
23:27 < othiym23> I would even buy multiple shirts if I could
23:28 < zot> hi!  using child_process, reading stdin.  on the data event, if the data contents are a "partial read", is there a way to simply defer, and let it buffer more?  or must I buffer those partial contents myself?
23:30 <@konobi> yerself
