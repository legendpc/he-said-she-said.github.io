00:00 < tracker1> working on it... it seems to have started in 0.8.13, rolled back to .12 then up to .13 no prob in 12, present in 13..
00:02 < tracker1> grr... 
00:06 < tnorris> tracker1: that makes sense. .14 was a small bug fix for .13, so you'd probably have seen the problem there.
00:07 < tracker1> tnorris, sorry, have to uninstall to get back to .12 so I can try something, then back to 13... lol
00:07 < tracker1> bit of a pita.
00:08 < tnorris> tracker1: ah, yeah. you're running on windows. np
00:08 < tracker1> my luck, probably isn't an issue present in a *nix environment
00:09 < DaMorpheuS> chilts ?
00:09 < tnorris> tracker1: heh, might be. but I really think that if there is some regression it will be because of the update to a new version of v8. not from node itself.
00:09 < tnorris> but we can test that.
00:11 < tracker1> just trying to separate out if I can the read from the less compiler (which drops out consistently it looks like)
00:13 < tracker1> crap... not working with the small test case..
00:13 < tracker1> :-(
00:14 < tracker1> should say, is not breaking.
00:16 < tnorris> tracker1: hm. well, that might be a good thing.
00:16 < tracker1> tnorris, maybe... will look into it more tomorrow...
00:16 < tnorris> tracker1: cool. I'm usually on during the day. hit me up if you find anything.
00:17 < tracker1> the script is using async, lessc, a cssminifier etc... so a bit much...
00:17 < tracker1> tnorris, will do.
00:17 < tracker1> funny, works in .12 though.
00:17 < TheAceOfHearts> so, I have a VM and I wanna install nodemon to have my app reset if it crashes... but I don't have root. What can I do @_@?
00:18 < tnorris> isaacs: the ArrayBuffer is essentially the same as Buffer. would you oppose the idea of extending ArrayBuffer's from SlowBuffer?
00:19 < chilts> DaMorpheuS: back
00:21 < TooTallNate> tnorris: why not regular Buffer?
00:23 < tnorris> TooTallNate: because in lib/buffer.js all the methods call "this.parent.<method_name>" where parent is SlowBuffer.
00:23 < tnorris> and figured i'd just skip a step.
00:23 < TooTallNate> tnorris: it's not skipping a step though, it's bypassing the optimizations that Buffer exist for
00:23 < TooTallNate> tnorris: the Buffer constructor is where the magic happens
00:25 < tnorris> TooTallNate: interesting. I've only been looking at methods like "toString" (which I really wish existed on typed arrays)
00:25 < TooTallNate> tnorris: basically regular Buffer instances are a slice from a parent SlowBuffer
00:26 < TooTallNate> tnorris: however, SlowBuffers are slower to make, since they do a malloc() behind the scenes
00:26 < TooTallNate> tnorris: with a Buffer, it's as cheap as creating a JS object, since presumably the parent SlowBuffer has already been created
00:27 < TooTallNate> overall, it's less trips across the JS/C++ border and less malloc() calls
00:27 < TooTallNate> tnorris: personally though, i think making ArrayBuffer inherit from Buffer makes sense to me
00:27 < sadjow> #falcon.js
00:28 < tnorris> TooTallNate: right now you can use a typed array view on a buffer (e.g. new Uint8Array(new Buffer(8)), which is really useful.
00:28 < tnorris> TooTallNate: guess from the API standpoint they just seemed a lot the same to me.
00:28 < TooTallNate> tnorris: oh wow! i didn't know that
00:29 < TooTallNate> tnorris: so what does ArrayBuffer do then? :p
00:29 < tnorris> TooTallNate: yeah, I've been using it on data streams between processes. no need to serialize the raw numbers. much faster.
00:29 < TooTallNate> tnorris: i can refactor my sine wave generator to use that! https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker/blob/master/examples/sine.js#L50
00:31 < tnorris> TooTallNate: awesome. you'll have to let me know how much that improves things.
00:31 < TooTallNate> tnorris: well speed isn't much of a concern, it's just one stream, but it'll clean up the code at least
00:33 < tnorris> TooTallNate: so, the point of an ArrayBuffer is so you can cast multiple views onto raw data. and ArrayBuffer's are supported by the latest browsers.
00:33 < tnorris> dude, node-speaker is sweet.
00:33 < TooTallNate> ah, so API compatability is a good reason
00:33 < TooTallNate> tnorris: thanks :)
00:35 < TooTallNate> tnorris: i've been using it all the time, pretty much replaced Spotify for me :p
00:35 < TooTallNate> well not that alone obviously, i've been listening to a lot of Icecast streams with speaker though
00:38 < tnorris> man. i'm just started to learn cpp addons for node. no trivial thing.
00:40 < TooTallNate> tnorris: well it's (partly) my job to make that as easy as possibly, so i'm open to suggestions
00:40 < sinclair_> tnorris: it's not that bad
00:41 < sinclair_> TooTallNate: do you know about node on azure ?
00:41 < TooTallNate> sinclair_: not really… what do you want to know?
00:41 < sinclair_> TooTallNate: i couldn't get native modules to work on azure :(
00:41 < tnorris> part of it is I haven't done a lot of cpp in years, and needed to bust out the manuals again.
00:41 < TooTallNate> oh, someone was asking about that same thing the other day
00:41 < TooTallNate> (could have been you :p )
00:42 < sinclair_> TooTallNate: maybe 
00:42  * sinclair_ has been ducking and diving between compilers, azure, native compilation and a few other things.
00:43 < sinclair_> TooTallNate: i couldn't get it working, azure wouldn't recognize the module, but i didn't get that far into it, i was going to load up node 0.6, iisnode, and try it locally to see if i could work out what the issue might be
00:44 < mscdex> tnorris: there are some good node-specific addon tutorials out there
00:44 < tnorris> mscdex: will I find those in the wiki?
00:44 < tnorris> keep forgetting about the wiki
00:46 < sinclair_> tnorris: on windows?
00:46 < tnorris> sinclair_: linux
00:46 < tnorris> wait, you mean what is my os?
00:46 < sinclair_> tnorris: shame, if you were on windows, and had VC++, i could have walked you through creating a native module in a few minutes. 
00:48 < tnorris> sinclair_: my main problem is figuring out how to convert between the standard types I know (like vectors) and types I can return to javascript.
00:48 < sinclair_> ah right
00:48 < TooTallNate> tnorris: that's just a matter of learning the V8 api
00:48 < TooTallNate> tnorris: http://izs.me/v8-docs/main.html
00:48 < TooTallNate> tnorris: also, looking through the node source code has lots of good examples
00:51 < gabrieluk> hi, the plugin page on the mongoose site is not working http://plugins.mongoosejs.com/
00:53 < tnorris> TooTallNate: I think I need to hit the cpp books harder. like in the following I'm not sure how to convert from a vector to a v8::Array https://gist.github.com/4035683
00:56 < tnorris> TooTallNate: but anyways, back to the original point. So it seems replacing Buffers with ArrayBuffers would be removing some optimization, but it may not be a bad idea to extend TypedArrays with the Buffer prototype?
00:57 < mscdex> tnorris: here's one: https://github.com/kkaefer/node-cpp-modules
00:57 < tnorris> mscdex: beautiful. thanks.
00:59 < TooTallNate> tnorris: SlowBuffer -> Buffer -> ArrayBuffer, i think that makes sense
01:00 < tnorris> TooTallNate: sounds good to me. "fill" and "toString" are really what I'm missing from ArrayBuffers
01:02 < zcourts> What's the recommended way for a node service to communicate with services in other languages? I was thinking websockets but haven't been able to find a maintained ws client for the server.
01:02 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
01:02 < tnorris> TooTallNate: ah, just remembered why I was extending from SlowBuffer. It's because I couldn't easily set .parent on the ArrayBuffer instance.
01:03 < TooTallNate> tnorris: it should get set in the Buffer constructor
01:03 < tnorris> TooTallNate: yeah, it does. but I didn't want to have to initialize a new Buffer object for every ArrayBuffer I was creating.
01:07 < TooTallNate> tnorris: it's a subclass though, so it should replace whatever ArrayBuffer is currently using to get the backing buffer
01:08 < TooTallNate> tnorris: i'm imagining something like: function ArrayBuffer(length) { Buffer.call(this, length); }
01:08 < tnorris> TooTallNate: well, damn. ArrayBuffer can't be extended in the js (guess I was being hopeful). the raw data in an ArrayBuffer isn't directly accessible. a view has to be used.
01:08 < tnorris> TooTallNate: but ArrayBuffer is built into v8. don't think we can replace it, can we?
01:09 < TooTallNate> tnorris: typed arrays are implemented in node, not V8: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/v8_typed_array.cc
01:10 < tnorris> TooTallNate: um, nope. Go to your chrome console and type `new ArrayBuffer(6)`
01:10 < TooTallNate> tnorris: sure, cause Chromium also implements them
01:10 < TooTallNate> tnorris: v8's example shell, d8, also implements them
01:10 < tnorris> ArrayBuffers are part of the es6 spec.
01:11 < tnorris> so why wouldn't they have been implemented directly in the v8 engine?
01:12 < tnorris> and it's possible I'm completely missing something. brain is fried at eod.
01:12 < TooTallNate> tnorris: i think eventually they will be, but it's still a draft
01:12 < TooTallNate> so in the meantime others have to implement it
01:12 < TooTallNate> at least that's my understanding
01:12 < tnorris> TooTallNate: grep dep/v8/src/d8.cc. ArrayBuffer is all over it.
01:13 < TooTallNate> tnorris: "d8" is v8's example shell
01:13 < TooTallNate> not part of v8 itself
01:14 < TooTallNate> tnorris: i believe once typed arrays are implemented in V8 directly, the plan is to phase out Buffers and use typed arrays everywhere
01:14 < TooTallNate> but that's a far-off dream
01:14 < tnorris> then where is the core of v8?
01:14 < mscdex> zcourts: there are two: https://github.com/einaros/ws  and https://github.com/Worlize/WebSocket-Node
01:15 < mscdex> d'oh :-)
01:15 < TooTallNate> tnorris: deps/v8/src, but d8.cc is it's own program that uses V8
01:15 < TooTallNate> all the other files are V8 itself
01:15 < TooTallNate> brb, Mario Kart
01:16 < context> hahaa ! tootallnate++
01:17 < tnorris> mother effing..... why the @#$ haven't ArrayBuffers been implemented as a standard data structure in v8?!?!?
01:22 < tnorris> TooTallNate: well, thanks for explaining that one final point. too bad I didn't realize that a week ago.
01:31 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs streams2-net * 9767f18 : test: Trigger old-mode in tests, and more output (+6 more commits) - http://git.io/CVo8ag
01:37 < Leo_> Uhh.. could someone give me the right way to download a image from a server, and save it to buffer as base64? what i am trying to do http://pastebin.com/RTYK0hE3
01:43 < mscdex> Leo_: the only thing that looks "wrong" is your path
01:43 < mscdex> Leo_: you're missing a preceding forward slash
01:44 < Leo_> ohh yeah '-'... thanks man..
01:45 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs streams2-net * a6baf2f : stream2: Always _read() when the lwm=0 - http://git.io/Wx3gYQ
01:54 < samholmes> Anyone here use knox? I know the second parameter to the deleteFile callback (res) is the HTTP response object, but how is it used; is it useful? Can there be an error that isn't captured in the first parameter in the callback (err)?
01:57  * samholmes has another question
01:57 < chilts> samholmes: I know that with AwsSum and using DeleteObject, the success param has things like the status code (204 for a successful request) and the headers returned - which mainly consists of two different request ids
01:58 < chilts> so not really that useful except to know that it worked :)
01:58 < samholmes> How can I delete an entire "dirctory" in S3 using knox?
01:58 < chilts> I'm not sure you can get a listing of the entire bucket with know but I could be wrong
01:59 < samholmes> chilts: Huh?
02:00 < chilts> ah, client.list() <- you can
02:00 < chilts> you need to list your entire bucket if you want to know what keys to delete (unless you have a copy of them all stored elsewhere)
02:01 < Leo_> Does anybody know a tutorial of sending multipart's post with node?
02:01 < chilts> remember that you can also delete multiple objects at the same time, not just one at a time : http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/multiobjectdeleteapi.html
02:02 < chilts> Leo_: take a look at the request package (npm show request)
02:02 < chilts> Leo_: https://github.com/mikeal/request/#forms
02:02 < Leo_> Thanks.
02:02 < chilts> no worries
02:04 < samholmes> chilts: I don't want to delete an entire bucket; I want to just delete a "directory".
02:05 < chilts> in S3 terms, there is not such thing as a directory (just keys) but if you know your "directory" path, then you'll have to do a list using the "path/to/dir/" prefix to get all the keys, then delete those
02:05 < chilts> hope that helps :)
02:06 < chilts> e.g. deleting all files in "my/dir/*" you'll have to do a list where Prefix = "my/dir/"
02:07 < samholmes> chilts: which is why I "double quoted"
02:07 < chilts> yeah, hard to tell that in irc :)
02:07 < chilts> anyway, does that help?
02:07 < samholmes> chilts: That helps. However, I wish there was an easier way provided by AWS.
02:07 < chilts> there isn't as far as I know
02:08 < samholmes> chilts: What if there are directories within directories?
02:08 < chilts> you can go into the console and do it that way :) there you can do an entire directory
02:08 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
02:08 < chilts> doesn't matter
02:09 < chilts> it's just keys (as I mentioned earlier)
02:09 < chilts> no such thing as "directories" (I even quoted it) :D
02:11 < samholmes> chilts: But, I wont be able to delete the inner "directory"/key if it contains other keys/directories.
02:13 < samholmes> chilts: I would need a recursive algorithm, no?
02:13 < chilts> you will ... if you ask for a list of keys with the prefix "path/to/dir/" it will include "path/to/dir/with/other/dirs/file.txt" etc
02:13 < chilts> no
02:13 < chilts> it's just a key/value store
02:14 < chilts> doesn't matter if the keys have slashes, dashes, backslashes or whatever you want as "directory" separators, since there is no such thing as directories
02:14 < chilts> it's just a flat list of keys
02:18 < samholmes> chilts: I see. Thanks so much. I'm glad that I wont have to create a recursive function now. :)
02:18 < chilts> :)
02:25 < samholmes> chilts: Weird. I'm getting an error saying that knox's client object doesn't have the method 'list'.
02:25 < chilts> what version of knox? might have been added recently
02:26 < chilts> if you can't get it working, I can point you to some code which uses AwsSum :)
02:27 < samholmes> chilts: old version. updated.
02:27 < chilts> samholmes: looks like v0.4.1 is the latest
02:27 < chilts> cool
02:29 < chovy> I have the same forEach loop all over the place, is there anyway to refactor this so I can re-use it everywhere? https://gist.github.com/79171bc2a790d8eae7cf
02:29 < samholmes> chilts: actually. It looks like `npm update knox` did nothing; I'm still at version 0.3.1
02:30 < chilts> check your package.json
02:30 < chilts> see what you're depending on
02:30 < samholmes> Ah I see. It's at 0.3.1
02:30 < samholmes> ~0.3.1
02:30 < chilts> hehe
02:31 < samholmes> Thanks!
02:31 < chilts> no worries
02:31 < chilts> am doing well today :)
02:31 < samholmes> I'll change it then run `npm update knox`. But is there a quicker way to update a module and update the package all in one swoop? XD
02:31 < samholmes> chilts: That you are. ;)
02:32 < chilts> I think because it's in your dependencies it'll adhere to that
02:32 < chilts> but you might be able to do something like 'npm install --save knox@0.4.1'
02:32 < chilts> try soemthing like that ... I didn't check the syntax
02:32 < samholmes> chilts: 
02:34 < samholmes> That works! :D
02:34 < chilts> heh
02:34 < chilts> bonux points for guessing :)
02:34 < chilts> bonus
02:34 < chilts> negative points for typos
02:34 < samholmes> chilts: I tried `npm update knox --save`, eheh
02:35 < chilts> which one worked, yours or mine?
02:35 < samholmes> too bad that doesn't work in npm to update the package and node_modules dir all in one
02:35 < samholmes> chilts: yours
02:35 < chilts> ok
02:35 < chilts> yeah, don't think I've ever used update
02:36 < samholmes> chilts: do you just run `npm install` and modify the package.json?
02:36 < chilts> sometimes, depends what I'm doing :)
02:37 < chilts> sometimes I install a bunch of stuff at the start of a project and only make the package.json later
02:37 < chilts> when I just want to write code
02:37 < samholmes> chilts: That's what I did too. So, I'm not used to this package.json business.
02:37 < chilts> get used to it thought, package.json and npm is great
02:44 < yawning> Is there a way to require a js file and have everything in that file's global scope end up in its exports?
02:50 < yawning> Is there a difference between global and GLOBAL?
02:53 < mscdex> yawning: no
02:53 < mscdex> yawning: except the one is in caps and the other isn't ;-)
02:54 < chilts> yawning: you need to make sure that the file you're including explicitely puts what you want into it's exports
02:54 < chilts> and yeah, variable names in JS are case-sensitive
02:55 < yawning> chilts: except global and GLOBAL are both defined and seemed to point to the same object :)
02:55 < samholmes> Weird. Why would data.Contents be undefined from client.list? #knox
02:55 < chilts> oh ok, maybe that's a Node.js thing :)
02:55 < chilts> samholmes: is there anything in the bucket?
02:56 < samholmes> chilts: Of course.
02:56 < chilts> :)
02:56 < samholmes> "/photos/7e750da3057893cb2377d790172f361e/"
02:56 < samholmes> is the prefix
02:56 < samholmes> maybe I have to prepend my bucket name?
02:56 < chilts> try it again without the preceding '/'
02:56 < yawning> I hoped there was some automagic way to turn some useful third party js files into commonjs modules
02:57 < chilts> yawning: how many vars does it declare that you want exported?
03:02 < yawning> chilts: Only two this time
03:02 < yawning> I was just thinking if I had a few more. And I wanted to upgrade them once in a while it might develop into a bigger annoyance.
03:03 < yawning> It's not a bigger but not a huge one
03:04 < yawning> that didn't come out right. :)
03:05 < chilts> heh
03:06 < chilts> yeah, I know what you mean, but yeah, don't worry about it now - optimise (your workflow) if you have to do it lots in the future :)
03:06 < chilts> or automate it :)
03:30 < cait-ar> I need some help with node-ffi, not sure if there's a separate irc channel somewhere for that project
03:30 < Riaku> ok im seriously confused, node just decides to not read anything below line 72 or so. no matter what is put there. 
03:30 < Riaku> https://gist.github.com/4036427
03:31 < cait-ar> I'm just not sure if I can pass a javascript object as a void pointer to a foreign function, or if I need to reference it first or what
03:31 < chilts> Riaku: looks like you might have an infinite loop on line 73
03:31 < Riaku> yeah chilts, that was after removing stuff, when i was attempting to locate why
03:32 < Riaku> let me check some stuff.
04:26 < daiushdiuahisdad> var fs = require('fs'); var total = 0; for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 	var ini = (new Date()).getTime(); 	var fname = 'message' + i + '.txt'; 	fs.writeFile(fname, 'Hello Node', function (err) { 	  if (err) throw err; 	  console.log(fname); 	  console.log(this.ini); 	  var fim = (new Date()).getTime(); 	  total += fim - ini;  	  console.log(i);  	  if(i == 9) { 	  	console.log(total); 	  } 	}); }
04:26 < daiushdiuahisdad> how can I benchmark this async code?
04:26 < daiushdiuahisdad> please
04:27 < sadjow> https://github.com/sadjow/falcon
04:27 < sadjow> any contributor
04:28 < daiushdiuahisdad> now in a gist
04:28 < daiushdiuahisdad> https://gist.github.com/4036787
04:28 < daiushdiuahisdad> could you help me, please?
04:29 < daiushdiuahisdad> how can I get the "ini" variable inside the writeFile callback, please
04:29 < Mortchek> daiushdiuahisdad, just `ini`
04:30 < Mortchek> daiushdiuahisdad, functions automatically have access to variables in outer scopes.
04:30 < daiushdiuahisdad> doesnt work :(
04:30 < Mortchek> daiushdiuahisdad, show what you've tried, and in what way it doesn't work.
04:31 < Mortchek> s/in/explain in/
04:32 < daiushdiuahisdad> Mortchek: i thinki need to get "i" to show the total time only in the last callback, but i == 10 before the first callback is executed...
04:32 < Mortchek> daiushdiuahisdad, oh, I bet your problem is this
04:32 < Mortchek> !last one @ daiushdiuahisdad 
04:32 < Mortchek> !last @ daiushdiuahisdad 
04:32 < Mortchek> Dang it, what was it?
04:32 < Mortchek> daiushdiuahisdad, you have a scoping issue.
04:33 < Mortchek> daiushdiuahisdad, ini is the same variable across all iterations.
04:33 < Mortchek> You can probably resolve this by wrapping the for body in an iife.
04:33 < Mortchek> !iife @ daiushdiuahisdad 
04:33 < Mortchek> Oh, ecmabot's dead.
04:33 < Mortchek> No wonder.
04:34 < Mortchek> … I thought I was in ##javascript
04:34 < Mortchek> heh
04:34 < Mortchek> Anyway, `for (…) { (function () { … }()) }` ought to do it.
04:37 < daiushdiuahisdad> Mortchek: trying... :)
04:38 < Mortchek> … Though, come to think of it, there's no reason to create a Date multiple times in the same function
04:38 < Mortchek> Sorry, I am probably too tired to be giving advice :P
04:38 < Mortchek> daiushdiuahisdad, basically, explain what's wrong rather than just saying it doesn't work, then we can figure out what to do.
04:42 < chovy> anyone want to take a stab at this?
04:42 < chovy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13281617/node-js-module-for-specific-block-of-code
04:42 < chovy> i don't see any other way
04:46 < cait-ar> can fs.open not open relative paths?
04:46 < cait-ar> i dun get it
04:46 < bnoordhuis> cait-ar: sure it can
04:46 < cait-ar> hmm
04:46 < bnoordhuis> cait-ar: but $PWD relative, not module relative
05:08 < chakrit> any recommendation for a node.js tcp hosting in the cloud?
05:08 < chakrit> tcp server*
05:09 < sugendran> you want a managed host?
05:11 < chakrit> managed, yeah.
05:12 < sugendran> then you probably want to look at nodejitsu or heroku
05:16 < chakrit> looked at both. heroku is surprisingly http-only while nodejitsu's multi-port support is "planned"
05:17 < jesusabdullah> neither service does tcp, your best bet is to get a machine directly from joyent or aws
05:17 < chakrit> hmm ok.
05:18 < chakrit> looking at joyent right now and wondering if there's any pre-configured machine or something?
05:18 < chakrit> ah.. i should pop into #joyent.
05:26 < sayd> anyone have an idea why npm is failing for me? here is debug log trying to install tap globally with latest node from machomebrew: https://raw.github.com/gist/33076d618414c3f8e650/d5017924b75985abe209393d91c056ecf681217e/npm-debug.log
05:29 < sayd> sorry jshint, not tap
05:30 < sayd> ls -g after the bad install says: npm ERR! missing: =@*, required by undefined@undefined
05:30 < sayd> UNMET DEPENDENCY = *
05:33 < chovy> Can someone help me understand why this works without having to return the original list? https://gist.github.com/7e110ef323d4432bdfef
05:40 < sayd> chovy: works?
05:42 < sayd> all i have in ~/.npmrc is dev = true
05:42 < sayd> and jshint won't build. i tried --production when installing too
05:43 < sayd> oh wow, removing that fixed my 'environment'
05:43 < sayd> i wonder what dev = true does to break stuff
05:50 < thealphanerd> does anyone know how to make a servers ip a variable in node
05:51 < Morranr> "a server" meaning...?
05:51 < thealphanerd> specifically I am running node on embedded devices that will have different ip's when attached to different networks… doing stuff with sockets… so I would like to have the ip in the client side socket IO call be a variable
05:52 < chovy> sayd: after calling help.eachPerson(item.wants); item.wants object is populate with avatar.
05:52 < chovy> sayd: traditionally, you would have to do something like:
05:52 < chovy> item.wants = help.eachPerson(item.wants);
05:52 < chovy> but that isn't necessary here.
05:53 < Morranr> thealphanerd: so you want the ip of the client, or the ip of the server that the client connects to?
05:53 < thealphanerd> so I am server the client html
05:53 < thealphanerd> I want to put the servers ip into that html
05:53 < thealphanerd> https://github.com/TheAlphaNerd/tilty.js/blob/master/public/index.html
05:53 < thealphanerd> as you can see here
05:54 < thealphanerd> oh wait my bad
05:54 < thealphanerd> sorry
05:54 < thealphanerd> here
05:54 < thealphanerd> https://github.com/TheAlphaNerd/tilty.js/blob/master/public/js/tilty.js
05:54 < thealphanerd> line 8… I call socket.io with the ip of the server
05:54 < thealphanerd> this is currently hand written… I would like that to be generated
05:55 < Morranr> so basically you need the IP of the server stored as a variable in the server?
05:55 < thealphanerd> yeah
05:56 < Morranr> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3653065/get-local-ip-address-in-node-js
05:56 < thealphanerd> and then I need the js to be modified prior to being sent to the client
05:56 < sayd> chovy: item.wants gets changed in place
06:14 < chovy> sayd: yeah, how is that?
06:15 < sayd> anyone know why d3 would be failing to install? https://gist.github.com/8e5f952defa9436a5de4
06:16 < sayd> chovy: its js, everything is a reference
06:16 < sayd> well not entirely true, but you invoked the function on that object and therefore its changing that same oject
06:19 < sayd> error canvas@0.13.0 install: `node-gyp rebuild`
06:20 < SomeoneWeird> thats one massive log sayd 
06:21 < sayd> SomeoneWeird: i know, can i make failed installs provide less info?
06:23 < sayd> did this guy go into hiding or something? https://github.com/tjholowaychuk
06:23 < sayd> only 4 followers.. thought he wrote express and such
06:23 < samholmes> git isn't a deployment tool. What do I do?
06:24 < sayd> ah here he is https://github.com/visionmedia
06:24 < sayd> samholmes: grunt?
06:25 < samholmes> Well, how do I deploy?
06:25 < SomeoneWeird> sayd, yeah all his stuff is under visionmedia
06:26 < SomeoneWeird> <samholmes> git isn't a deployment tool. What do I do? < sure it is
06:26 < sayd> weird, i don't see canvas there
06:26 < SomeoneWeird> sayd, https://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas
06:26 < samholmes> SomeoneWeird: That's not what the folks at #git say.
06:26 < SomeoneWeird> pfft
06:27 < TehShrike> samholmes: npm!
06:28 < sayd> SomeoneWeird: thanks .. npm install --production seems to have worked
06:28 < sayd> but i don't see canvas when i do npm ls
06:28 < samholmes> TehShrike: What about it?
06:28 < SomeoneWeird> sayd, go into the canvas dir and run npm link 
06:28 < TehShrike> samholmes: deploy software with it?
06:29 < TehShrike> ionno, it sounds reasonable to me - you can set it up on your own servers and stuff
06:29 < sayd> SomeoneWeird: I dont know where that is
06:29 < sayd> slash its not there
06:29 < SomeoneWeird> how did you install it/
06:29 < SomeoneWeird> *?
06:29 < sayd> cloned d3 repo
06:29 < SomeoneWeird> right, so go into that
06:29 < SomeoneWeird> and run npm link
06:30 < sayd> canvas is in devDependencies
06:30 < sayd> but i did npm install --production
06:30 < SomeoneWeird> then run --development
06:30 < SomeoneWeird> npm install --development
06:30 < samholmes> TehShrike: But it all goes in a public directory. I don't want my IP in there. :
06:30 < sayd> whats npm link
06:30 < samholmes> :|
06:30 < SomeoneWeird> samholmes, just use git
06:30 < TehShrike> samholmes: no, I mean, you can set up your own personal npm
06:31 < TehShrike> The whole thing is open source, isaacs was cool enough to make that pretty reasonably possible
06:31 < samholmes> TehShrike: I didn't know that.
06:31 < sayd> SomeoneWeird: https://gist.github.com/c3b19ac3b8a6afe5b807
06:31 < TehShrike> samholmes: I know!  It's totally sweet!
06:32 < samholmes> TehShrike: SomeoneWeird is saying that I could just use git.
06:32 < TehShrike> Well, sure
06:32 < TehShrike> And I've used SVN
06:32 < TehShrike> But I really love having a package manager whose point is to handle dependencies for me
06:32 < samholmes> How do you deploy with npm?
06:32 < TehShrike> npm install my-product
06:33 < samholmes> git push remotevps is how I'd guess to do it with git. How do you do that with npm?
06:33 < samholmes> tehShrike: I don't understand..
06:33 < TehShrike> Same way as you do with the regular version of npm
06:33 < samholmes> TehShrike: I don't deploy with npm.
06:33 < samholmes> Regularly*
06:33 < TehShrike> But you've used it?
06:33 < samholmes> I've used it yes
06:33 < samholmes> I've used it to install packages
06:34 < samholmes> npm install packagename
06:34 < TehShrike> Have you released anything with it?
06:34 < samholmes> npm ls to list
06:34 < samholmes> I have
06:34 < samholmes> npm publish
06:34 < TehShrike> So the "module" is just a directory with a package.json file
06:34 < TehShrike> And that's what your products would be
06:34 < TehShrike> They could have dependencies on other "modules" that you make
06:34 < samholmes> So my whole application is a module?
06:34 < TehShrike> Which is one thing that SVN (and I'm guessing git) don't handle well
06:35 < TehShrike> Relying on another cross-product module
06:35 < TehShrike> That is somewhere else in the repository
06:35 < samholmes> Are you saying I should use npm publish to deploy?
06:35 < TehShrike> Doesn't that sound more attractive than checking out a path from a repository?
06:36 < TehShrike> I mean, checking out from a repository is better than other things I can imagine
06:36 < TehShrike> But package managers do solve a lot of problems that repositories don't
06:36 < samholmes> TehShrike: I suppose it does.
06:36 < samholmes> However, how would I do it?
06:37 < samholmes> Currently, the best I got is FileZilla.
06:37 < sayd> SomeoneWeird: I tried upping to canvas 0.13.1 (.1 revisision newer) but its still failing
06:37 < samholmes> Now, I have set up git and a package.json file.
06:37 < TehShrike> On npmjs.com, buried in the FAQs and whatnot, you can find instructions on installing it yourself
06:37 < TehShrike> I think the github readme has info as well
06:37 < samholmes> Installing npm?
06:37 < TehShrike> I think installing a couchdb database is most of it?
06:37 < TehShrike> Yeah
06:37 < samholmes> I already have it installed.
06:37 < TehShrike> No, not the client
06:37 < TehShrike> The server
06:37 < samholmes> Ah
06:38 < samholmes> I install a npm repository on my VPS, or my localhost?
06:38 < TehShrike> Yeah
06:38 < samholmes> I see
06:38 < samholmes> but is it on my VPS or localhost?
06:38 < SomeoneWeird> probably vps
06:38 < TehShrike> Whatever is accessible to all the machines you want to deploy to
06:39 < samholmes> And there's a way to password protect the npm repo?
06:39 < TehShrike> Those machines will need the npm client, and then you point npm at your personal server
06:39 < SomeoneWeird> just firewall it off samholmes 
06:39 < TehShrike> I don't know.  I suppose if worst comes to worst you could use HTTP auth
06:40 < sayd> i guess i need cairo.. https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/issues/225#issuecomment-9807788
06:40 < SomeoneWeird> lol
06:40 < SomeoneWeird> it says that in the faqs
06:41 < sayd> oops
06:41 < SomeoneWeird> sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
06:43 < chovy> do jade partials work recursively?
06:43 < chovy> in ejs it keeps trying to find the nested partial relative to the ancestor, not the parent partial that included it.
06:44 < chovy> i'm using ejs-locals
06:44 < SomeoneWeird> ejs supports partials ootb does it not?
06:45 < SomeoneWeird> <% include file %>?
06:49 < mdedetrich> is there a way to catch all exceptions (even if they happen in future callbacks) in something like express?
06:52 < chovy> SomeoneWeird: i need a partial though, which allows you to pass in data
06:52 < chovy> mdedetrich: http://expressjs.com/guide.html#error-handling
06:53 < mdedetrich> chovy: I tried that, and the app is still exiting
06:53 < chovy> SomeoneWeird: an include won't work, because I need to rename the collection the partial expects in some cases: <% partial('faces', { people: item.users });
06:53 < SomeoneWeird> you can do that
06:53 < mdedetrich> chovy: it doesn't catch all unhandled exceptions
06:53 < SomeoneWeird> just access item.users in the included template
06:53 < chovy> SomeoneWeird: an include won't work, because I need to rename the collection the partial expects in some cases: <% partial('faces', { people: list.users });
06:54 < SomeoneWeird> ...
06:54 < chovy> sorry, i did that twice
06:54 < SomeoneWeird> mdedetrich, process.on('unhandledException
06:54 < SomeoneWeird> maybe
06:54 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: yeah I tried but, I have no idea how to resume the request
06:54 < SomeoneWeird> you can't
06:54 < chovy> SomeoneWeird: I need to pass in "people" which can come from anywhere.
06:54 < mdedetrich> thats bloody retarded
06:54 < SomeoneWeird> an exception gets thrown for a reason
06:54 < mdedetrich> in other languages you can just catch exceptions from anywhere and then send a request
06:55 < chovy> mdedetrich: you can try/catch here, no?
06:55 < SomeoneWeird> yes
06:55 < chovy> if ( err) next(err);
06:55 < mdedetrich> chovy: its in a callback
06:55 < mdedetrich> chovy: try catch wont work if the exception happens in a callback
06:56 < SomeoneWeird> why not
06:56 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: because its the semantics of a language
06:57 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: try/catch in js is lexically scoped to the current function thread
06:57 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: it will never catch something that is thrown in a callback
06:57 < SomeoneWeird> right, so put it in the callback?
06:57 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: I can't, its in another library
06:57 < terinjokes> mdedetrich: define "callback"?
06:57 < SomeoneWeird> ah
06:57 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: also thats a stupid solution
06:57 < SomeoneWeird> depends what you define a callback as
06:58 < SomeoneWeird> as terinjokes asked
06:58 < mdedetrich> if the function makes, for example, an async callback that can then throw an error
06:58 < mdedetrich> a try/catch clause wont work
06:58 < terinjokes> i think you meen something that starts a new call stack, but a straight callback is still catchable
06:59 < mdedetrich> terinjokes: well its generally this
06:59 < mdedetrich> terinjokes: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3677783/is-it-possible-to-catch-exceptions-thrown-in-a-javascript-async-callback
07:00 < terinjokes> :) stackoverflow is smart enough to redirect me, even when tmux breaks iTerm2's URL detection :)
07:00 < mdedetrich> I mean there is a reason whey every async call in nodejs uses the return(err,…..) standard
07:00 < SomeoneWeird> mhm
07:00 < terinjokes> mdedetrich: yes, exactly
07:00 < mdedetrich> the err is there because you can't catch errors thrown on function callbacks, so you have to track them exactly
07:01 < SomeoneWeird> yep
07:01 < mdedetrich> the problem is, people aren't forced to use that, and the library I am using is throwing errors
07:01 < mdedetrich> that are killing the webapp
07:01 < terinjokes> throwing exceptions on new threads has to be done carefully, but that's hardly a JS-only issue
07:01 < terinjokes> mdedetrich: fix the library?
07:01 < mdedetrich> terinjokes: Id rather be able to catch any type of exception
07:02 < SomeoneWeird> well, you can't
07:02 < SomeoneWeird> :)
07:02 < mdedetrich> terinjokes: I don't want the app exiting due to some random thing in some one off library
07:02 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: and thats JS being retarded
07:02 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: no other language has this limitation
07:03 < SomeoneWeird> it's not js
07:03 < SomeoneWeird> it's node
07:03 < mdedetrich> no its a js semantic
07:03 < mdedetrich> its part of language specification
07:03 < SomeoneWeird> mmmmmk
07:03 < mdedetrich> in ECMA
07:03 < sayd> how would i satisfy this dep in osx #include <jpeglib.h>
07:04 < mdedetrich> as I said, try/catch is lexically spoked for the current function stack
07:04 < SomeoneWeird> use another lang then
07:04 < rendar> mdedetrich: so its v8 that does that?
07:04 < mdedetrich> rendar: any valid implementation of javascript does that
07:05 < mdedetrich> rendar: v8 runs javascript scripts, mozilla's javascript engine would do the same thing
07:05 < mdedetrich> and so would microsofts I assume
07:05 < SomeoneWeird> heh
07:05 < mdedetrich> I mean the whole point of try/catch is to catch any possible error, to prevent your application from crashing
07:05 < mdedetrich> thats what it does in every other language
07:05 < SomeoneWeird> yeah, so you put the try, catch in the callback
07:06 < SomeoneWeird> it's the library you're using
07:06 < mdedetrich> nonono
07:06 < mdedetrich> regardless
07:06 < mdedetrich> of if its in callbacks
07:06 < mdedetrich> or anything
07:06 < SomeoneWeird> k
07:06 < ljharb> try/catch doesn't work with an async model.
07:06 < mdedetrich> it will catch EVERYTHING
07:06 < mdedetrich> regardless if its in another thread
07:06 < SomeoneWeird> ljharb, as we've said..
07:06 < ljharb> which is why you need to make sure exceptions are never throw without being caught
07:06 < ljharb> (i just jumped in)
07:06 < mdedetrich> ljharb: yup, and I am saying its retarded
07:07 < mdedetrich> ljharb: because other languages don't have this stupid limitation
07:07 < ljharb> of course they do
07:07 < ljharb> if they use an asynchronous model
07:07 < mdedetrich> scala doesn't, C# doesn't
07:07 < ljharb> it's not "retarded", it's just not for async programming.
07:07 < SomeoneWeird> LOL
07:07 < astropirate> ljharb, debatable :|
07:07 < ljharb> scala uses futures. i'm pretty sure try/catch works the same as it would in a node app.
07:07 < mdedetrich> C has no exception handling, and better not talk about C++'s exception handling
07:08 < mdedetrich> ljharb: you can catch exceptions thrown by futures in scala
07:08 < ljharb> mdedetrich: read this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4296505/understanding-promises-in-node-js
07:08 < ljharb> that explains the PROPER way to deal with recovering from errors in an async model.
07:08 < mdedetrich> ljharb: without actually having to change the code being executed i nfuture
07:08 < ljharb> try/catch doesn't work - and that's because its the wrong tool. use the right tool instead.
07:08 < ljharb> oh wait thats the wrong link
07:09 < ljharb> one sec
07:11 < ljharb> mdedetrich: https://gist.github.com/3889970
07:11 < ljharb> thats the one
07:12 < ljharb> specifically "The point of promises is to give us back functional composition and error bubbling in the async world."
07:13 < ljharb> using try/catch in an async model is just as useless and inappropriate as using classes and classical inheritance in a language that only has prototypical inheritance.
07:17 < mdedetrich> ljharb: whats a good future library in js
07:17 < substack> ljharb: the pain of async error handling is useful
07:18 < ljharb> substack: i suspect i agree with you, but could you elaborate?
07:18 < substack> because it leads me to decompose gross complicated nested logic into lots of tiny pieces
07:18 < ljharb> ah, true
07:18 < substack> many of which can be published to npm
07:18 < ljharb> mdedetrich: i've just used https://npmjs.org/package/promises
07:20 < mdedetrich> ljharb: the thing is, I have essentially been doing this https://gist.github.com/3889970#gistcomment-588675
07:20 < mdedetrich> ljharb: but by using the async library
07:20 < mdedetrich> ljharb: which works fine if the librarys actually do the proper return(err,….)
07:21 < mdedetrich> the library I am using does async stuff but wont catch and then return the err
07:21 < mdedetrich> the problem with promises is they are incredibly expensive
07:22 < rendar> mdedetrich: why so expensive?
07:22 < larryapplegate> Thanks to Coverslide, I am getting further with the Smashing node MongoDB and Mongoose examples. But I still have errors in both projects, which I have put on github:
07:22 < larryapplegate> https://github.com/larryapple/Smashing-MongoDB
07:22 < mdedetrich> rendar: its explained in this gist
07:22 < mdedetrich> rendar: https://gist.github.com/3889970#gistcomment-588675
07:22 < ljharb> mdedetrich: expensive? what on earth are you doing that makes that even worth thinking about?
07:23 < mdedetrich> oh wait
07:23 < mdedetrich> wrong one, sec
07:23 < larryapplegate> https://github.com/larryapple/Smashing-Mongoose
07:23 < rendar> thanks
07:24 < ljharb> mdedetrich: also that guy's iferr/throwerr solution looks small in coffeescript, but when degrossified and turned into normal JS, it looks pretty awful - i can't see how it's less expensive than promises.
07:24 < larryapplegate> If anyone can look at the projects, I would appreciate it.
07:25 < chovy> chapel: you there?
07:25 < ljharb> larryapplegate: whats the purpose of smashing mongoose?
07:25 < larryapplegate> these are examples in the book "Smashing Node.js"
07:26 < ljharb> oh ok it's just homework
07:26 < larryapplegate> the author doesn't provide files, just pieces of code which you must put together
07:26 < chovy> ljharb: degrossified :)
07:26 < larryapplegate> well, i want to do something very similar in my app
07:27 < ljharb> chovy: coffee stunts your growth :-p
07:27 < chovy> yup
07:27 < larryapplegate> and it might be useful to others who have the book to have code that actually works
07:27 < chovy> it causes heart attacks
07:28 < mdedetrich> ljharb: because your dealing with things like timeouts and whatnots
07:31 < ljharb> mdedetrich: can you show me an example? also when do you need timeouts?
07:33 < SomeoneWeird> function a() { console.log('a'); setTimeout(function(){a()},500) };
07:33 < SomeoneWeird> there
07:33 < SomeoneWeird> lol
07:40 < ljharb> SomeoneWeird: lulz.
07:55 < samholmes> It doesn't seem very intuitive to publish your entire app as a module to npm's public registry or any registry for that matter.
07:55 < samholmes> But, I guess this is how it's done if I want to use npm as a deployment tool.
07:56 < SomeoneWeird> git
07:56 < SomeoneWeird> git
07:56 < SomeoneWeird> git
07:57 < samholmes> SomeoneWeird: But, the other guy was saying npm was better. :S
07:57 < SomeoneWeird> heroku, etc all use git to deploy
07:58 < SomeoneWeird> https://gist.github.com/1809044
08:02 < samholmes> SomeoneWeird: thank you. I'll quite this npm non-sense and focus entirely on deploying with git.
08:11 < JasonWoof> I just wrote a password generator for fun, and now I'm starting to consider using it. How can I get good random numbers?
08:11 < JasonWoof> I read that v8 seeds with the system clock, which is a bit guessable
08:12 < JasonWoof> Should I use srand bindings? eg https://github.com/isaacs/node-srand/blob/master/package.json
08:12 < ivasilov_> JasonWoof: let your cat walk over the keyboard. Guaranteed randomness.
08:12 < samholmes> SomeoneWeird: This is the error I'm trying to get around http://pastie.org/5344231
08:12 < JasonWoof> ivasilov_: nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn222bjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
08:13 < wltsmrz> http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback
08:13 < samg_> I'm using node to write some client side code, because it is the best environment to do javascript TDD that I have found. How am I supposed to organize my code so that I can easily test individual units in isolation and also easily bundle everything together? I like the simplicity of node's require, which makes me lean toward something like browserify. Thoughts?
08:13 < JasonWoof> samholmes: you generally shouldn't be pushing to a non-bare repo
08:14 < samholmes> JasonWoof: Well, when I make it bare, all the files that were in .git are scattered in the working directory.
08:16 < JasonWoof> samholmes: when it's bare, there is no working directory
08:16 < samholmes> JasonWoof: What good is this deployment if there is no WD?
08:16 < samholmes> I need the files on my server in order to run my app.
08:17 < JasonWoof> samholmes: this your server? (with ssh access and all that?)
08:17 < samholmes> JasonWoof: Yes
08:17 < JasonWoof> samholmes: ok, maybe my setup will work for you. lemme dig up my notes
08:20 < JasonWoof> samholmes: ok, so I have bare repos on my server (in my home directory). one for each site. they all have a post-update hook which does a git checkout -f in the htdocs/xxx directory
08:21 < JasonWoof> I'll paste the scripts. you'll have to adapt them to your file paths probably
08:21 < samholmes> Wait
08:22 < JasonWoof> k
08:22 < samholmes> So everytime you push to your bare repo, you copy the latest commit data over to another directory where your app is hosted/running?
08:22 < JasonWoof> I asked about the best way to do this in #git a while back, and found out you can "git checkout" from a bare repo anywhere
08:22 < JasonWoof> my code is a bit hacky about submodules
08:23 < samholmes> What's the point of a bare repo when a non-bare repo does this anyway?
08:23 < Kakera> do you guys prefer `return { /* huge object */ };` or `var obj = {}; /* lots of statements adding to object */ return obj;`
08:23 < samholmes> Why not just put a bare repo in a /.git dir and then set up the checkout to checkout to /../ ?
08:23 < JasonWoof> samholmes: git assumes that a non-bare repo has people editing the files, and is not happy about remote pushes
08:23 < pyrotechnick> Kakera: the former but sometimes you need the latter
08:24 < JasonWoof> samholmes: I don't remember all the reasons, I was partially trusting the folks in #git
08:24 < samholmes> JasonWoof: So does github use bare repos?
08:24 < JasonWoof> samholmes: another reason is it doesn't give http access to your repo
08:25 < JasonWoof> samholmes: iirc github wrote their own database/storage backend/thinger for git
08:25 < JasonWoof> they certainly don't have working copies checked out somewhere
08:26 < SomeoneWeird> <JasonWoof> samholmes: another reason is it doesn't give http access to your repo < ?
08:26 < JasonWoof> I use the same submodule in most of my websites, and a second one in many of them
08:27 < JasonWoof> having the bare repos separate, enabled me to have just one copy of the repo for each of these submodules, and check them out (the corresponding revisions of them) into each website
08:28 < JasonWoof> SomeoneWeird: yeah, often your database credentials and such are in your versioned files. You really don't want your website visitors having access.
08:28 < SomeoneWeird> if you're doing that, then you're doing it wrong
08:28 < JasonWoof> you can block access with .htaccess and the like, but it would suck a lot if you forgot, or got the rules wrong
08:28 < samholmes> So, basically, the way you have it setup is that you have a bare repo that you push to; you set up some kind of event listener that does a git checkout to a specific directory on the event of a push?
08:28 < JasonWoof> SomeoneWeird: where do you put your db credentials? I've never seen a php framework that didn't have them in a php file
08:29 < SomeoneWeird> env vars, seperate config file that you don't checkin etc.
08:29 < JasonWoof> samholmes: yes. .git/hooks/post-update shell script, which calls ~/bin/pushpub (which is the same for all sites)
08:30 < JasonWoof> SomeoneWeird: ok, now it's slightly less likely to get into the wrong hands, and slightly more likely that you will lose it
08:31 < SomeoneWeird> 'lose' it?
08:31 < samholmes> JasonWoof: Isn't /.git in a non-bare repo simply a bare repo?
08:31 < JasonWoof> SomeoneWeird: yeah, I tend to think that all the  files I need for a project are in git. If I violate that assumption, I'm going to do something stupid sooner or later
08:31 < SomeoneWeird> heh
08:31 < JasonWoof> samholmes: yes, a bare repo is just the .git directory
08:31 < JasonWoof> samholmes: (with a setting in it that says it's bare)
08:32 < samholmes> JasonWoof: So, if I simply append /.git to my remote URL on my localhost repo, then I could push to it without any complaints from git! :D
08:32 < JasonWoof> samholmes: dunno, I guess it just made sense to me. the git repo is not something I want served by apache, so it seems like a good idea in general not to put it in htdocs
08:32 < AAA_awright> Also a bare repo has no HEAD
08:32 < samholmes> AAA_awright: I'm not even sure what a HEAD is in git.
08:33 < AAA_awright> Wait yes it does
08:33 < JasonWoof> samholmes: HEAD it points to the commit you have checked out
08:33 < AAA_awright> Or the branch
08:34 < AAA_awright> HEAD isn't a branch but it can look like one
08:34 < samholmes> Eh, there's a lot to get used to with git..
08:34 < JasonWoof> samholmes: so on the server I have ~/git-www/ in there I put the bare repos, and name the directory/repo for each site with it's exact domain name
08:34 < ljharb> samholmes: http://gitimmersion.com http://try.github.com
08:34 < [AD]Turbo> hola
08:35 < JasonWoof> Then I give it a post-update hook: echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n\n$HOME/bin/pushpub "$(basename "$(pwd)")"' > "$REPO/hooks/post-update"
08:36 < AAA_awright> Also, it is possible to maintain multiple Git repositories revisioning the same directory
08:36 < ljharb> JasonWoof: whats pushpub?
08:36 < AAA_awright> You just might need to set GIT_DIR
08:36 < JasonWoof> ljharb: that's my script which sets up ENV vars and such to checkout any of my bare repos into htdocs/whatever
08:37 < AAA_awright> GIT_DIR=.git git checkout theApplication
08:37 < ljharb> ah
08:37 < AAA_awright> GIT_DIR=config.git git checkout localConfigurationBranch
08:37 < AAA_awright> Tricky, no?
08:38 < JasonWoof> pushpub: http://paste.debian.net/207403/
08:39 < ljharb> it shouldn't need to be that complicated. on my git server i have a post-receive hook, and all it has in it is `GIT_WORK_TREE=/path/to/dir/ git checkout -f`
08:39 < goku22> How can we communicate with a machine behind a router… I am able to get only the ISP IP address with x-forwarded-for
08:39 < ljharb> starts with #!/bin/sh of course
08:39 < ljharb> goku22: you can't.
08:39 < JasonWoof> yeah, the checkout is pretty simple. just convenient to have the rules about how a domain maps to a file path in one place. The complex part of the script is getting the correct versions of the submodules checkout out in the right place. It's hardcoded for the submodules/paths I use unfortunately.
08:40 < ljharb> JasonWoof: yeah adding submodules makes it more complicated
08:40 < ljharb> JasonWoof: but i bet you could just iterate through .submodules or whatever (haven't used them in awhile)
08:40 < JasonWoof> goku22: change the settings on your router
08:40 < samholmes> JasonWoof: About what you said about it not being accessible form HTTP. Git repos aren't necessarily accessible from HTTP anyway. I'm using ssh:// protocol to add them as a remote, and even then, you'll need the username/password to access it.
08:40 < goku22> I want something which works universally
08:40 < JasonWoof> ljharb: yeah, it that didn't occur to me until recently
08:41 < goku22> I don't want to set a static ip to my machine on my router
08:41 < JasonWoof> ljharb: I'll do that if I ever start using other submodules
08:41 < goku22> or forward a static port 
08:41 < ljharb> goku22: if you want something on a machine accessible to everyone, it can't be behind a router. that's why people pay for hosting services.
08:41 < JasonWoof> goku22: if you've got a server somewhere you could do a reverse tunnel with ssh
08:41 < ljharb> goku22: it's silly to host services on a home connection anyways.
08:41 < goku22> i want the server to be able identify the client
08:41 < goku22> i want to communicate with the client using the client's ip as ID
08:42 < goku22> i am hosting the app on heroku
08:42 < ljharb> goku22: you can't, because IPs aren't IDs. what about universities, or workplaces - there's thousands of computers behind an IP
08:42 < goku22> yeah i know
08:42 < JasonWoof> goku22: wait... what? tell us what you're trying to do
08:42 < goku22> i am developing a p2p software
08:42 < ljharb> through a web browser?
08:42 < SomeoneWeird> lols.
08:43 < ljharb> also, have you heard of bittorrent? don't reinvent wheels.
08:43 < goku22> its for my masters project
08:43 < AAA_awright> ljharb: It's probably not a file transfer protocol
08:43 < JasonWoof> goku22: clients behind a router generally only know their local IP address (not the internet-accessible one) though there are ways of finding out (you just ask anybody on the internet what address you're contacting them via)
08:43 < ljharb> AAA_awright: neither must be bittorrent.
08:43 < ljharb> AAA_awright: bittorrent works wonderfully for streaming audio and video, for example.
08:44 < JasonWoof> goku22: but I'm having trouble imagining how your server could have any use for knowing the client's local IP
08:44 < AAA_awright> ljharb: Which is a form of file transfer
08:44 < AAA_awright> ljharb: What about messaging?
08:44 < ljharb> AAA_awright: what isn't a form of file transfer?
08:44 < ljharb> a message is a file.
08:44 < JasonWoof> streaming is file transfer
08:44 < AAA_awright> You have to download it, you have to know what you're downloading ahead of time
08:44 < JasonWoof> just with the assumption that you'll delete the file as it plays
08:45 < goku22> i am using it to check and show the client's file download progress
08:45 < AAA_awright> If I'm trying to subscribe to arbritrary data, bittorrent isn't designed for that
08:45 < ljharb> AAA_awright: that's only with bittorrent clients. the protocol is more than capable of handling complex interactions.
08:45 < goku22> its working fine with local IPs within router
08:45 < ljharb> AAA_awright: hm, i think maybe i see what you mean
08:45 < goku22> is it harmful to use mac ids?
08:46 < goku22> for identification
08:46 < SomeoneWeird> lawlllll
08:46 < AAA_awright> As far as I know, bittorrent won't stream live television, for instance
08:46 < JasonWoof> goku22: your p2p should probably keep track of computers it's connected to by the local port number of the connection
08:46 < SomeoneWeird> maybe you should do a little bit more research before you try to develop a p2p protocol
08:46 < JasonWoof> goku22: (or the file descriptor or whatever it's called)
08:46 < ljharb> goku22: you can't GET mac ids. there is no form of identification you can use unless the user provides it somehow.
08:46 < ljharb> how are you writing peer to peer software if you don't have a solid grasp of basic networking?
08:46 < AAA_awright> ^^
08:47 < goku22> i tried giving some arbitrary port but no success … what is the typical range over which ports are rarely used
08:47 < goku22> i know :(
08:47 < AAA_awright> goku22: You should probably read up on networking before proceeding
08:47 < JasonWoof> ljharb: can bittorrent get you data for which you don't know the hash? eg something like live-streaming where at the time you start watching, nobody (including the original seeder/uploader) knows the hash of the data later in the stream?
08:47 < AAA_awright> The well-known ports are >1024 iirc
08:47 < AAA_awright> er
08:47 < JasonWoof> less than 1024
08:47 < goku22> u mean the well known ports are lesser than 1024
08:48 < ljharb> JasonWoof: yeah thats what AAA_awright was saying. and altho i'm not sure, i do know that BitTorrent the company is working on live video streaming using bittorrent - so i think the answer is "not yet"
08:48 < JasonWoof> though there's some standardized higher ones too
08:48 < ljharb> goku22: you can't get in to machines through any port. that's how routers, firewalls, etc work. you'd have to tunnel out from each machine, through central servers that DO have open access.
08:48 < AAA_awright> ljharb: The way I'd do it is you subscribe to a certain private key, and you receive signed live data
08:48 < AAA_awright> certain *public key
08:48 < AAA_awright> signed with a private key
08:48 < ljharb> makes sense to me. altho i'm not sure why you'd necessarily need the encryption
08:48 < goku22> ljharb : could you expand or link me to a post which does 
08:49 < JasonWoof> you need the encription (signing) to tell if you're getting the correct data or not
08:49 < AAA_awright> ljharb: Well how else would you authenticate the source
08:49 < ljharb> goku22: you need to learn undergraduate networking knowledge before you can do master's-level work. there's no "post" that will explain it
08:49 < AAA_awright> ljharb: Normally you identify a file by the hash of it's contents, but if you don't know the contents, you can't use a hash
08:50 < ljharb> AAA_awright: yeah i guess you just said signed, not encrypted
08:50 < JasonWoof> that's why .bittorrent files have all those hashes in there... so you can tell who's really sending you the file, and who's spewing /dev/urandom at you
08:50 < goku22> if i give a unique enough port will i be able to get through the router without pre configuring it or not
08:50 < JasonWoof> goku22: no
08:50 < AAA_awright> goku22: no
08:51 < JasonWoof> goku22: read up on upnp
08:51 < ljharb> goku22: there are ZERO ports. otherwise i could hack into your computer as if it was a bad movie.
08:51 < AAA_awright> >_<
08:51 < chovy> goku22: like setting up email
08:51 < AAA_awright> goku22: A router has to be configured to forward packets first
08:51 < chovy> i've discovered there really is no post that explains it
08:52 < JasonWoof> I'd love to see some sort of extension to bittorrent protocol where you could subscribe to content signed by a certain key
08:52 < JasonWoof> this could potentially do live-streaming, as well as fully decentralized podcasting
08:53 < AAA_awright> Or even e.g. add new files to a collection
08:53 < ljharb> JasonWoof: i'd bet that BT, inc will come out with it sooner than later.
08:53 < JasonWoof> ljharb: that would be cool
08:53 < AAA_awright> If you want to subscribe to a podcast, and have the owner upload new files periodotically
08:53 < chovy> JasonWoof: live streaming would be good. tv is only just beginning to go online.
08:53 < AAA_awright> And automatically update them
08:54 < chovy> my grand children will be saying "Can you believe gramps? He still has cable"
08:54 < JasonWoof> I was trying to dream up a good way to get debian packages (and the package list if possible) distributed p2p. Bittorrent seemed impractical for multiple reasons
08:54 < bigkevmcd> JasonWoof: the difficulty with what you're proposing, for live-streaming at least, is that there's no guarantee you'd get the packets in the right order, which is somewhat essential for "live" tv
08:54 < bigkevmcd> tho', it might make some TV more interesting
08:54 < JasonWoof> lol
08:55 < JasonWoof> bigkevmcd: same thing with ethernet packets. and yet somehow TCP manages to work pretty well
08:55 < chovy> i thought there was a way to do p2p and request them in order. I seem to recall that from a long time ago.
08:55 < bigkevmcd> JasonSmith: streaming is usually done with UDP
08:55 < bigkevmcd> oops sorry JasonSmith
08:55 < chovy> like it does a buffer first, then starts requesting out of order once the buffer is kept.
08:55 < ljharb> JasonWoof: https://github.com/lg/murder
08:55 < SomeoneWeird> JasonSmith, ... tcp orders itself
08:55 < bigkevmcd> JasonWoof: and the thing about UDP is that it doesn't care if the packets are in order
08:55 < JasonWoof> bigkevmcd: yeah, and fixing the order of incoming packets is a problem that's been solved at many layers, eg TCP
08:55 < ljharb> bittorrent's just fine for deployments of things.
08:55 < bigkevmcd> JasonSmith: it drops the ones that out of order
08:56 < bigkevmcd> oops
08:56 < bigkevmcd> man, tab-complete will be the death of me :-)
08:56 < JasonWoof> bigkevmcd: I think there has been some success in implemented a streaming bittorrent client. (not live-streaming, but just playing a file as it's downloading.)
08:57 < bigkevmcd> JasonWoof: BitTorrent Live?
08:57 < JasonWoof> tab-complete is awesome, it's other people with my first name that's a problem ;)
08:57 < JasonWoof> bigkevmcd: I forget, I think tribbler was trying to do this. it mostly just crashed on my computer though
08:57 < ljharb> ah yes, thanks bigkevmcd http://live.bittorrent.com/
08:57 < ljharb> JasonWoof: bittorrent already came out with it: v
08:58 < ljharb> http://live.bittorrent.com/
08:58 < ljharb> yay internet.
08:58 < bigkevmcd> "Media is delivered with stunningly low delay by utilizing a UDP Screamer protocol."
08:59 < JasonWoof> wait, it's locked to h.264 and aac?
08:59 < JasonWoof> aren't those the most proprietary popular formats there are?
08:59 < JasonWoof> aren't we supposed to use webm?
09:00 < ljharb> haha no
09:00 < JasonWoof> this sounds a little proprietary too: "The ability to run a video source is not currently available to end users."
09:00 < ljharb> actually you could for most things. doesn't work in IE9 or below, or in safari.
09:01 < JasonWoof> I didn't say send a webm file directly to the browser, I mean for use over the bittorrent-ish p2p livestreaming protocol
09:01 < JasonWoof> no browser supports that
09:01 < JasonWoof> so you can use whatever codecs you want
09:02 < JasonWoof> in which case I'd assume you'd pick codecs with good compression quality that are free
09:02 < JasonWoof> eg webm
09:02 < JasonWoof> (I know webm isn't a codec, but you get my drift)
09:02 < bigkevmcd> you could transmit over the bittorrent live, and then stream video from your local bittorrent live client
09:02 < bigkevmcd> ...to the browser
09:07 < chovy> or you could just pay $200/month for cable.
09:07 < chovy> i don't know why they want to stop piracy.
09:07 < JasonWoof> "just" $200?
09:07 < bigkevmcd> probably to increase revenue
09:08 < JasonWoof> piracy is great for revenue
09:08 < chovy> i guess they've become quite attached to my $200 monthly gift.
09:08 < chovy> actually, the tv part is $100
09:09 < chovy> if you include hd + sports package.
09:09 < chovy> we need a hulu or netflix for live sports.
09:09 < JasonWoof> what their terrified of is the attitude that data/media/etc is something you get online for free, and that any sort of barrier (eg a pay wall) is annoying, and should be skirted
09:09 < chovy> yeah.
09:09 < JasonWoof> or that we'd get our content directly from the people that make it
09:10 < chovy> they like the $200/month and don't want people to stop 
09:10 < JasonWoof> it's the distributors that are freaking out
09:10 < JasonWoof> we don't need the distributors
09:10 < JasonWoof> 12 year olds can distribute all the movies most people care about for free already
09:10 < JasonWoof> can and do
09:11 < chovy> its pretty amazing that in less than 10 years, nobody buys cds anymore. all the music stores are closed, and blockbuster dvd went out of business.
09:11 < chovy> i guess it was hollywood video, wherehouse, etc. All used to sell/rent dvds/cds
09:11 < JasonWoof> I don't think we're going to stop wanting people to make new quality content, but I do think the need for huge corporations for distribution has already ended
09:11 < chovy> now you just get all that online.
09:11 < chovy> ebooks and video are next
09:11 < JasonWoof> yep
09:12 < JasonWoof> and the big distributors that are left are trying to make sure we still get stuff from them as we go online
09:12 < JasonWoof> not from bittorrent
09:12 < JasonWoof> bittorrent cuts out the distributors, but it still needs the creators
09:12 < chovy> yes, but they are making it very difficult.
09:12 < JasonWoof> who's making what difficult?
09:12 < chovy> espn had a free live stream you could get online, they got sued, and now you have to login with you tv-provider credentials.
09:13 < JasonWoof> ahh contracts
09:13 < chovy> mlb.tv is the only good live sports i've seen online, they have local blackouts, but you can get around that with tor.
09:13 < JasonWoof> my friend was considering getting rid of cable and just watching tv online, but he wanted to see sports stuff as it was happening (or near enough to it)
09:13 < chovy> nfl only does it for mobile, and i guess nba has desktop etc. but i don't watch much basketbalbl.
09:13 < chovy> yuyp
09:14 < chovy> i didn't have cable for 2 years. then i wanted to watch football and baseball.
09:14 < chovy> we used torrent and netflix for everything else.
09:14 < JasonWoof> I've heard that most popular tv shows become easy to watch for free online fairly quickly, but with sports, showing up on the internet mere hours (or minutes?) after the show is done is too late
09:14 < chovy> yeah
09:15 < chovy> there are random streams of big sporting events online, but I haven't found any good place to find them.
09:15 < JasonWoof> bittorrent.com's p2p livestreaming might solve that problem
09:15 < chovy> like thursday night football you can find it pirated online live.
09:15 < chovy> i wanted to get pac-12 network online, because they flat out don't even offer it in my area. 
09:15 < JasonWoof> sure, any massively popular video (of anything) I expect to see on bittorrent
09:16 < chovy> for $100/season I can watch every baseball game live. That's not bad at all, considering I pay $100/month for Tv now.
09:16 < chovy> but you have to hook up your pc to tv, etc.
09:17 < chovy> but it's decent, hd.
09:17 < JasonWoof> still seems pricey to me, but then, I'm not used to paying for media
09:17 < chovy> it is a little high
09:17 < chovy> I only did audio for a long time, that was like $29
09:17 < JasonWoof> I don't understand why cable is so expensive, it's not like they do anything
09:18 < chovy> then i saw the hd video and jumped on it.
09:18 < chovy> u-verse is a rip off too
09:18 < chovy> they are all about the same price
09:18 < JasonWoof> either there's a lot of expenses I'm clueless about (probably the case) and/or they're screwing us over bigtime (probably also the case)
09:18 < chovy> i think its both
09:19 < chovy> it's like selling software i imagine. The first copy is very expensive to produce. But after that...the 2nd copy is $0.
09:19 < JasonWoof> I hope all the major distributors go out of busines
09:19 < JasonWoof> it'll be rough for a bit as we adjust
09:19 < chovy> i don't know. people still buy magazines i think. and newspapers, but it's definitely in decline.
09:19 < JasonWoof> p2p streaming will take a while to get good
09:20 < JasonWoof> mostly only older folks buy newspapers
09:20 < JasonWoof> a friend of mine was on the front page of the local paper
09:20 < JasonWoof> people at work kept coming over to show him, or talk about it.
09:20 < JasonWoof> after a while he realized it was only people over 45
09:20 < chovy> if i rode the bus to work i would buy a paper
09:20 < chovy> lol
09:21 < JasonWoof> it's probably different in different parts of the world
09:21 < chovy> and those 45+ who manage to get online are probably getting viruses because they are going to all the wrong places.
09:22 < JasonWoof> and using an old version of IE
09:23 < chovy> yup
09:23 < chovy> i remember my dad had a horrible problem with that when he tried looking for porn online.
09:23 < JasonWoof> I'm so glad that IE doesn't have the majority of the market share anymore
09:24 < JasonWoof> oh, did he try to install the missing codecs?
09:24 < chovy> i kept having to re-install windows xp
09:24 < chovy> he would just click and download whatever, thinking he'd get to watch some booty.
09:24 < chovy> 9 times out of 10 it was  a virus.
09:24 < JasonWoof> should set him up with ubuntu
09:25 < chovy> i tried that. he was anti anything but ms
09:25 < chovy> i couldn't even get him to use firefox
09:25 < JasonWoof> that way even if he follows the whole tutorial on how to install the virus, it won't work, because they're generally not written for linux
09:25 < JasonWoof> there's gotta be a M$ theme for ubuntu :)
09:25 < chovy> its like trying to convince a Ford guy to buy a Chevy
09:26 < JasonWoof> just tell him it's Windows 8 ;)
09:26 < chovy> yeah, i should have done that. only he probably would've asked me why his card game he bought doesn't work.
09:26 < chovy> well, he's dead now, so I dn't need to worry about it anymore :)
09:26 < JasonWoof> oof, sorry to hear that
09:27 < chovy> thanks
09:27 < chovy> my mom is the same way though. I am trying to get her to buy a mac. and she gets pissed.
09:27 < chovy> at least she doesn't look for porn online.
09:27 < JasonWoof> hehe
09:27 < astropirate> for all you know : DON DON DOOONN!!
09:27 < JasonWoof> waaaa?
09:29 < JasonWoof> I really want to see updatable bittorrent streams
09:29 < chovy> it was funny when my mom wanted to offer all his old cds to the rest of the family (very religious folk)...and his porn cd I made him was in the collection.
09:29 < JasonWoof> I ran miro for a while, that was cool
09:29 < chovy> i should have let her do it
09:29 < JasonWoof> but it all had to come from RSS, so I only used it for legal downloads
09:29 < astropirate> wait what?
09:29 < astropirate> lolol
09:30 < JasonWoof> chovy: um, no, I think you made the right choice
09:30 < chovy> my mom would have died.
09:31 < JasonWoof> trying to reunite them are you?
09:31 < chovy> lol
09:31 < chovy> that's what i was afriad of
09:33 < JasonWoof> whaat?!? we have guacamole in the fridge?
09:33 < JasonWoof> hot diggity damn
09:33 < JasonWoof> and it's not even brown yet!
09:33 < chovy> i was just gonna say, you'd better hurry
09:34 < JasonWoof> I brought home leftover chips from the local mexican place today too
09:34 < JasonWoof> oh happy day!
09:35 < JasonWoof> I tried freenet a couple times
09:35 < JasonWoof> pretty cool that the browsing part can be done over p2p
09:35 < chovy> what is freenet?
09:35 < JasonWoof> but it was so mind-bogglingly slow that it seems useless
09:36 < JasonWoof> chovy: very very privacy oriented p2p network
09:36 < JasonWoof> chovy: it runs as a daemon, and includes a webserver that makes it so you can browse the content on the p2p network with your web browser
09:36 < JasonWoof> people can publish pages to the p2p cloud
09:36 < chovy> is that like tor?
09:36 < chovy> it has its own private network too
09:37 < JasonWoof> no, tor is just proxies
09:37 < JasonWoof> with freenet you can publish content to it and then disconnect
09:37 < chovy> you can publish with tor anonymously and serve too
09:37 < chovy> oh, so the content is in the cloud
09:37 < JasonWoof> yeah, but not on amazon, it's on many people's computers, encrypted
09:37 < JasonWoof> so very few of those computers can read the files
09:38 < JasonWoof> data gets coppied around when it's requested, so it's supposed to handle swarming
09:38 < chovy> i worry about these so called anonymous networks
09:38 < JasonWoof> and data that doesn't get requested gets bumped off the stores eventually
09:38 < JasonWoof> freenet's been around for a while
09:38 < chovy> makes sense
09:39 < JasonWoof> it's cool for research, but I have my doubts that that particular code-base will ever become popular. it's written in java and is an amazing memory hog
09:39 < JasonWoof> and is very slow generally
09:39 < chovy> but if you are opening yourself up for hosting kiddie porn and all kinds of other black stuff, then eventually you will get caught or accused of it.
09:40 < JasonWoof> I remember several years ago they said the recommend giving it 1GB and letting it run all the time. I was running a computer that I'd upgraded to 600MB of ram
09:40 < JasonWoof> chovy: maybe, but you can't tell what the content is
09:40 < chovy> i think there is a way.
09:40 < SomeoneWeird> lawl JasonWoof 
09:41 < JasonWoof> chovy: they might be able to tell you have some, but they can't tell that you know you have some
09:41 < JasonWoof> or that it's your fault you have it
09:41 < chovy> no, but i doubt that would really matter. 
09:41 < chovy> you'd have to hire a good attorney.
09:41 < JasonWoof> it's a little risky, yes. but they're doing what they can
09:42 < chovy> someone will probably get busted and thrown in jail for life because they were serving kiddie porn with it unknowingly
09:42 < JasonWoof> and that's actually part of the reason it's so crappy... they usually choose to sacrifice speed for anonymity/security
09:42 < JasonWoof> s/crappy/unpopular/
09:42 < JasonWoof> most people go with bittorrent which is much more risky, but fast
09:42 < chovy> yeah
09:43 < JasonWoof> chovy: I don't know. comcast does that all the time
09:43 < JasonWoof> (serve kiddie porn without knowing it)
09:43 < chovy> comcast will send out cease and desist letters to people.
09:44 < JasonWoof> you can look at the freenet project as a free speech advocacy project
09:44 < chovy> but there is other dark stuff online, like assassination forums and death matches and shit.
09:44 < JasonWoof> I think two things are slowly coming to light:
09:44 < chovy> all supposedly anonymous on the darknet
09:45 < JasonWoof> 1) you either have privacy and security (including online financial transactions) or you have constant/pervasive sensorship and spying
09:45 < JasonWoof> 2) uhhh... I thought I had two
09:46 < JasonWoof> maybe I merged them. basically you can't have private communication or secure credit card transactions without being able to secretly transmit kiddie porn
09:46 < chovy> yup
09:46 < JasonWoof> privacy is binary
09:46 < chovy> thankfully i need neither
09:47 < SomeoneWeird> lol
09:47 < chovy> i guess all the hitmen use bitcoin
09:47 < samholmes> JasonWoof: You basically do the first solution on http://sitaramc.github.com/the-list-and-irc/deploy.html ?
09:47 < JasonWoof> fortunately for those of us who care about free speach and/or privacy, there is a _lot_ of money behind keeping it possible to do secure financial transactions online
09:47 < SomeoneWeird> lol, chovy 
09:47 < SomeoneWeird> only if you use SR ;)
09:48 < chovy> SR?
09:48 < SomeoneWeird> goooooogle
09:49 < chovy> JasonWoof: lot of money behind anonymous transactions?
09:49 < AAA_awright> Privacy is not binary
09:49 < AAA_awright> Just the existance of it
09:49 < SomeoneWeird> <JasonWoof> fortunately for those of us who care about free speach and/or privacy, there is a _lot_ of money behind keeping it possible to do secure financial transactions online < bitcoin, is exactly that
09:49 < AAA_awright> Security isn't binary in any way, neither is trust (especially not trust)
09:49 < chovy> SomeoneWeird: SR? the SR Programming Lanugaage? Don't know what you're gettin' at
09:50 < JasonWoof> chovy: dunno about anonymous, just paying online, like at amazon.com or something
09:50 < SomeoneWeird> silkroad
09:51 < JasonWoof> by "privacy is binary" I didn't mean to be super accurate, I just mean either the government/whoever can decrypt your messages, or they can't
09:51 < JasonWoof> if the encryption is done right, there's no middle ground
09:51 < JasonWoof> though, of course sometimes the encryption doesn't go right
09:51 < SomeoneWeird> mhm
09:52 < JasonWoof> I'm not sure (I haven't studied/researched this) but I don't think bitcoin is very good for money laundering
09:52 < chovy> so you're saying we get stronger encryption we can use to be anonymous, because there's lots of money behind developing encrypted transactions...I'll agree with that.
09:52 < chovy> JasonWoof: i don't know, i just read it was popular on the dark internet
09:53 < JasonWoof> I think that part of the reason that strong encryption is legal is that the vast majority of people see a lot of value in being able to pay online
09:53 < chovy> yeah
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> <JasonWoof> I'm not sure (I haven't studied/researched this) but I don't think bitcoin is very good for money laundering < it's not
09:54 < JasonWoof> and I think that this (the fact that people care about being able to pay online) continues to be a force for free speech
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> (i'm sure some other idiots would agree otherwise though)
09:54 < JasonWoof> ie when someone suggests that the government should be able to spy on every packet and decrypt everything to catch the bad guys, it's helpful to be able to say that this kills online shopping
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> if you guys think bitcoin is only used for illegal stuff you're soooooooooo wrong ahah
09:55 < JasonWoof> I _don't_ think bittorrent is very useful for money laundering
09:55 < chovy> JasonWoof: i gotcha
09:56 < JasonWoof> everybody downloads the whole transaction history, and we have really good algorithms for figuring out all the connections, mapping the money in to the money out
09:56 < JasonWoof> money laundering works by doing transactions where it's as hard as possible for others to get a transaction log
09:57 < JasonWoof> I think bitcoin is cool
09:57 < ivasilov_> JasonWoof: I don't think that matters
09:57 < chovy> iv'e never used bitcoin
09:57 < SomeoneWeird> bitcoin is awesome
09:58 < SomeoneWeird> -> /j #bitcoin
09:58 < SomeoneWeird> ;)
09:58 < chovy> what is cool about it?
09:58 < JasonWoof> ivasilov_: what (matters)?
09:58 < ivasilov_> JasonWoof: If you don't know where the money enters or leaves bitcoin (I'm referring where it transfers to normal money) you can't follow it easily
09:58 < JasonWoof> chovy: I like that it's totally decentralized. and thus censor-proof
09:58 < SomeoneWeird> and instant
09:58 < Industrial> How do I call a request/response pair? Need a var name :P
09:58 < SomeoneWeird> and no fees
09:59 < chovy> so wht is bitcoin in a nutshell?
09:59 < JasonWoof> chovy: I think that there are often very important entities that are doing things that big business and or big government don't like. (eg wikileaks) and I like the idea that there's a currency they could use that can't just be shut off
10:00 < JasonWoof> the US government has started freezing people's online payment systems (like paypal, mastercard, etc) without a triel
10:00 < JasonWoof> trial
10:00 < Industrial> JasonWoof: any criminal ogranization can make use of this aswell
10:00 < SomeoneWeird> chovy, www.weusecoins.com
10:00 < JasonWoof> Industrial: yep
10:00 < JasonWoof> Industrial: same with anything useful
10:01 < Industrial> I guess :)
10:01 < JasonWoof> Industrial: I don't think we should shut down the internet because crimitals use it.
10:01 < JasonWoof> Industrial: or autlaw bricks :)
10:01 < Industrial> haha
10:01 < chovy> can you actually buy stuff using bitcoin online, or is it like paying someone under the table for yard work.
10:01 < JasonWoof> that's how it works with powerful tools generally: you can do very important/positive things, and cause a lot of harm
10:02 < Industrial> no you start to see more and more ways to pay for anything with bitcoin
10:02 < Industrial> I, for a fact, am trying to get bitcoin hooked into my online payment system
10:02 < Industrial> =)
10:02 < SomeoneWeird> chovy, of course you can
10:02 < JasonWoof> chovy: it's a currency, you can pay people for anything (as long as they accept that currency)
10:03 < SomeoneWeird> there are hundreds of legit businesses only doing bitcoin related stuff
10:03 < SomeoneWeird> should probably move the convo over to #bitcoin ?
10:03 < ivasilov_> Industrial: what online payment system?
10:03 < JasonWoof> chovy: you can make your own currency (and people often do, usually a white piece of paper that says "IOU")
10:03 < Industrial> the one I'm planning/creating :)
10:04 < chovy> heh
10:04 < chovy> bit-ous
10:04 < JasonWoof> bitcoin is not designed around privacy, it's designed to be censor-resistant
10:04 < JasonWoof> (by being decentralized)
10:04 < chovy> so chargebacks can be good if you're the one wanting one. like if you get ripped off by someone. 
10:05 < JasonWoof> chovy: yeah, there are advantages to having a middle-man
10:05 < SomeoneWeird> mhm
10:05 < NodeX> governments need to re-adopt the gold standard
10:05 < chovy> is there any kind of escrow service for bitcoin?
10:05 < SomeoneWeird> ofc chovy 
10:05 < SomeoneWeird> :)
10:06 < NodeX> most of this crappy economy will go away
10:06 < Industrial> I keep some bitcoins on my phone, havent ever paid anyone with them though :P
10:06 < ivasilov_> NodeX: Golden standard is not the solution
10:06 < JasonWoof> I don't think the gold standard will stop the dollar from plummeting
10:06 < chovy> SomeoneWeird: what is ofc?
10:06 < SomeoneWeird> of course
10:07 < Industrial> Can I use an object (e.g. an a http.Request) as a key in an object?
10:07 < SomeoneWeird> yes
10:07 < SomeoneWeird> oh, key?
10:07 < SomeoneWeird> doubtful
10:07 < SomeoneWeird> actually maybe
10:07  * SomeoneWeird hides
10:07  * JasonWoof tries it
10:08 < JasonWoof> so far, seems like "no"
10:09 < Industrial> looks like it toStrings the object, then uses the string as the key
10:09 < JasonWoof> oh, wait, I messed up
10:09 < JasonWoof> does seem to work
10:09 < NodeX> ivasilov_ : currency needs to be backed by something else it's wothless
10:09 < JasonWoof> seems like a bad idea though
10:09 < NodeX> and seeing as gold doesnt degrade it's the most logical solution
10:10 < SomeoneWeird> >> a = "lol"; b = {}; b.a = "lolol"; b[a]
10:10 < purr> SomeoneWeird: undefined
10:10 < SomeoneWeird> >> a = "lol"; b = {}; b[a] = "lolol"; b[a]
10:10 < purr> SomeoneWeird: (string) 'lolol'
10:10 < Industrial> yeah, I wanted O(1) lookups of responses by request :P
10:10 < JasonWoof> hmmm... yes, it does seem to be stringifying the objects
10:10 < chovy> i'm off to bed. later
10:11 < JasonWoof> 'night chovy
10:11 < JasonWoof> >> a = {}; a[JSON] = 1; JSON.stringify(a)
10:11 < purr> JasonWoof: (string) '{"[object JSON]":1}'
10:12 < _z_> c'est quoi le canal irc en francais de node?
10:12 < NodeX> non
10:12 < mike4x4> hello
10:12 < _z_> quoi non?
10:12 < _z_> ya pas?
10:13 < mike4x4> hello which is the best open source irc server?
10:13 < mike4x4> i would like to create an avatar chat which runs from irc
10:13 < NodeX> I use unreal - it's pretty good
10:14 < _z_> hein qui mrepond là
10:14 < Industrial> I'm trying to see how I can use streams to chop up my app into very small parts. I thought I could make one stream that emits HTTP requests and another to (eventually hopefully with a lot of steps in between) respond. https://gist.github.com/71344b17b5181b46285b/c3f3ba7f01cd737641d72d370eea0235a1a8141e The problem is the requests stream emits data events with every req/res and and end event when the server
10:14 < Industrial> closes (with .stop() for example)
10:14 < _z_> ya un francais ici au moins???
10:14 < NodeX> un petit francais
10:15 < mike4x4> unreal is fast and stable on windows server and nickserv can run from mysql database?
10:15 < _z_> ya pas de chan fr nodeX?
10:15 < NodeX> non
10:15 < JasonWoof> _z_: Je ne pense pas qu'il y est un canal irc pour node.js en français. Je pense que l'anglais est utilisé pour le développement de la plupart des node.js. (translate.google.com)
10:15 < Industrial> Should I create a Response Stream for each request?
10:16 < _z_> woot
10:16 < Industrial> Or can I keep one per Request stream/server
10:16 < NodeX> mike4x4 : I dont know
10:16 < NodeX> stable and windows don't really live in the same sentence
10:16 < SomeoneWeird> loll
10:16 < _z_> jasonwoof: okay but u should learn french guy
10:16 < NodeX> LOL
10:16 < Industrial> _z_: right, no, the point is, you should learn english.
10:17 < Industrial> (and so should I ;p)
10:17 < JasonWoof> _z_: I learned a little in grade school (something like first through 6th grade) but most of my french teachers were stupid and/or mean
10:18 < JasonWoof> that and I didn't see the point
10:18 < JasonWoof> I did visit Montreal a couple times though, that made me want to learn their version of French
10:18 < sashman> i aaaalways get things NOT working like it should work by following instructions ytf i just want to integrate bootstrap in layout.jade but it doesnt do it argh
10:19 < bigkevmcd> _z_: make your best attempt in English, it's not like we're not used to broken English on the internet...
10:19 < NodeX> especialy in IRC
10:19 < SomeoneWeird> yep
10:19 < bigkevmcd> *especially
10:19 < bigkevmcd> ;-)
10:20 < JasonWoof> sometimes we get so used to broken English that it changes the way we type, and people think we are not native speakers
10:20 < _z_> i think that i should start the #node.js-fr chan
10:20 < JasonWoof> has happened to me 2 or 3 times anyway
10:20 < _z_> with NodeX
10:21 < NodeX> :P
10:21 < _z_> parler le francais, c'est beau
10:21 < NodeX> I goto France next week
10:21 < NodeX> vacation \o/
10:21 < _z_> speak english is no fun for us
10:21 < bigkevmcd> _z_: my french-speaking developer friends would say otherwise
10:21 < NodeX> I only speak a little French
10:22 < JasonWoof> no fun for you! sorry, you're not allowed to have any.
10:22 < _z_> since node is pure fun, i dont see why u should force some community to speak in fun-less langs
10:22 < NodeX> in fairness english is a stupid language with stupid rules
10:22 < JasonWoof> _z_: sorry, that's just the way it is. You can either use node, or have fun. can't have it both ways.
10:23 < _z_> NodeX: paris?
10:23 <@Nexxy> JAVASCRIPT IS FUN AND SO NODE IS FUN
10:23 < NodeX> Toulouse
10:23 < JasonWoof> NodeX: true that
10:24 < NodeX> this whole i before e business only works about twice in the whole language
10:24 < NodeX> so why have a rule for it LOL
10:24 <@Nexxy> la plate-forme officielle de node.js
10:24 < JasonWoof> NodeX: oh come on, it's more than half the time! ;)
10:24 < _z_> :notbad:
10:25 < _z_> and if you doesnt create a chan for frenchs, can we speak french here?
10:25 < JasonWoof> there's so much value in having a world language that most people know
10:25 < JasonWoof> it's a bit unfair that this is becoming english
10:26 < JasonWoof> but I don't think we should go with chinese, because I like keyboards
10:26 <@Nexxy> english *is* the world language that most people know
10:26 < NodeX> more than half the planet speak spanish in one form or another dont they?
10:26 < JasonWoof> I don't know the numbers, but afaik: yes, english is becoming the world language
10:26 < JasonWoof> not because it's better, but because have most of the money
10:27 < bigkevmcd> we'll see how long that lasts :-)
10:27 < JasonWoof> well, by the time India and China have most of the money, they'll all be speaking English :)
10:27 < _z_> im not speaking of fucking money or numbers god!
10:28 < _z_> im speaking about the love of french, or another langage, just that
10:28 < Industrial> What is better? arr[arr.length] = newItem; or arr.push(newItem); ?
10:28 < bigkevmcd> I'd always do arr.push
10:28 <@Nexxy> arr.push looks nicer
10:28 < NodeX> +1
10:29 < NodeX> _z_, you also have to remember that most if not all computer languages are english based
10:29 < NodeX> (at the core)
10:29 < NodeX> and we're in the computer age
10:32 < _z_> the computer age, lol
10:32 < _z_> my god, why people loves rules
10:32 < _z_> even programmers :s
10:32 <@Nexxy> because understanding each other is good
10:32 < _z_> NodeX, join me on #node.js-fr
10:33 < _z_> And if there are some french here, just come
10:33 < Industrial> have fun :X
10:33 < rendar> _z_: only 1 language for every human beings would make things very, very easier
10:33 < rendar> :)
10:34 < Industrial> How do I compare/uniq an array of objects? a={f:'g'};b={f:'g'};a===b;  =>  false
10:35 < Industrial> so say I have an array of a's and things like a, how do I filter out all the duplicates
10:35 < nail_> and that language should be Newspeak
10:36 < SomeoneWeird> Industrial, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960473/unique-values-in-an-array
10:36 < _z_> (Pour les francophones qui sont ici, voici le nouveau chan, pour nous: #node.js-fr)
10:37 < Industrial> thanks
10:44 < zonetti> tips on minimizing the cpu usage?
10:44 <@Nexxy> don't do so many computations
10:45 < SomeoneWeird> lawl
10:49 < NodeX> LOL
10:52 < lhnz> hi guys, quick question -- i have some javascript libraries that were developed for the client-side by another company. I want to use them on the server-side but they don't have any exports, i really want to avoid editing them as much as possible. will i need to edit them to add in module.exports = { ... } or is there a way around this?
11:00 < JasonWoof> OK, finished my password generator. it was inspired by http://xkcd.com/936/
11:01 < JasonWoof> I decided to stick with four random words, and make my word list long enough so the four words would have exactly as many combinations as 8 random printable ascii characters (so ascii 33-126)
11:02 < JasonWoof> that's 8836 words
11:03 < JasonWoof> so I wrote a crazy shell script to scrape my pidgin logs (all of them) remove the html, split into words, remove symbols, etc, and sort by frequency, then some coffeescript to remove anything that wasn't in /etc/dictionaries-common/words 
11:04 < JasonWoof> at 8836 words, the words don't get obscure at all
11:04 < JasonWoof> and at this late hour, I'm finding some of the passwords it comes up with quite amusing. such as "hidden poop pulls missed"
11:04 < SomeoneWeird> lawl
11:04 < JasonWoof> I'm imagining a "PULL!" from behind a bush, and then a cow pie wizzing by my head
11:05 < SomeoneWeird> ....>_>
11:05 < substack> heylookit https://github.com/substack/secure-peer
11:05 < JasonWoof> and more innocuous ones, like how some part of the bowling alley feels: "lane pockets want grass"
11:05 < substack> it's like ssh only it works over any stream and you can verify the public key in an event listener
11:05 < SomeoneWeird> oh, nice substack 
11:05 < SomeoneWeird> now write gpg bindings plz :3
11:07 < JasonWoof> some aren't funny, but show the bias towards technical subjects (most of my logs are from programming and/or free software chat rooms) such as "vulnerabilities troubleshooting tactical done"
11:07 < JasonWoof> or "verbatim procrastinating consuming kicking"
11:08 < JasonWoof> for a fair number of them (one out of every three or four?) it's pretty easy to come up with a picture/scenario to help remember it
11:09 < JasonWoof> then every once and a while there's one that seems to be describing something. eg "doubtful colorful puff babies"
11:11 < JasonWoof> I like the idea of giving my clients "redirected motor rumors finch" instead of "P(7n]tJ$"
11:12 < SomeoneWeird> ye
11:16 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: oh btw
11:16 < mdedetrich> SomeoneWeird: found a solution to my issue, its called domains
11:16 < mdedetrich> http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html
11:36 < jchannon> hi
12:05 < _geo> how can i check what a "module" exports once i require it ?
12:06 < _geo> should i use underscoer , _.keys / _.functions ?
12:06 < _geo> *underscore
12:13 < AAA_awright> _geo: Why the scare quotes around "module"

13:01 < denysonique> Hey
13:03 < denysonique> Is it possible to make Node's regex engine character classes to match Polish word characters: e.g. \w would match  any of: ąść?
13:05 < denysonique> By setting some locale for example
13:10 < SomeoneWeird> >> "ąść".match(/\w/)
13:10 < purr> SomeoneWeird: (object) null
13:11 < SomeoneWeird> >> "ąść".match(/./)
13:11 < purr> SomeoneWeird: (object) ['ą']
13:35 < Industrial> So I had a crazy idea; Have a Graph of Node's with Edge's that are Stream's (so I guess it's directed) https://gist.github.com/865510bdbd3a04d2ee97/3adbdc17cabefd316c080fe030bb51af8159de42
13:48 < Industrial> https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js#L38 Where is .write() defined?
13:49 < SomeoneWeird> good question lol
13:51 < Industrial> pipe takes a stream, but it's a method of stream, and calls methods like end and write on the dest stream, but I can't find those defined.
13:51 < Industrial> I'm trying to write subclasses of Stream, but I need to see what to do in the default case xD
13:58 < mscdex> denysonique: xregexp has unicode support which gives you access to \p{...}: http://xregexp.com/plugins/#unicode
14:01 < syav1991> Can anyone please tell me what does "session not defined" mean in jade?
14:03 < syav1991> Need help debugging "session not defined" error in jade... 
14:04 < syav1991> Need help debugging "session not defined" error in jade... Anyone???
14:04 < Industrial> syav1991: are you trying to use any session variable? did you define a variable session?
14:04 < larzconwell> Gotta love error messages.
14:05 < syav1991> Industrial: I made a simple search engine as part of a college course project... The app works like Google's home page...
14:06 < syav1991> Industrial: If the user is not logged in, then the option on top is to sign in...
14:06 < larzconwell> Did it give you a stack trace or anything useful?
14:06 < syav1991> Industrial: Else it should show the user's name and log out option...
14:06 < xcat> So I couldn't help but notice that basically no distro supports node.js yet
14:07 < xcat> WHY
14:07 < Industrial> syav1991: what is in the template context? the object you send to the template compiler?
14:07 < Industrial> xcat: just compiling it is easier
14:07 < Industrial> and more cutting edge
14:07 < Industrial> syav1991: are you trying to use a variable in the template that is not in the context object?
14:08 < larzconwell> xcat,  Distro level packages would be horribly out of date anyway(excluding ones with rolling release models). 
14:10 < xcat> Is it hard to install from source?
14:10 < SomeoneWeird> debian/ubuntu repo is always up to date
14:10 < SomeoneWeird> xcat, wget <node.tar.gz link> && tar xvf <filename> && cd <folder> && ./configure && make -j 4 && make install
14:11 < xcat> -j 4?
14:12 < SomeoneWeird> uses 4 cores
14:12 < SomeoneWeird> ie. compiles 4 things at once
14:12 < xcat> Oh, neat
14:12 < SomeoneWeird> change it to however many cores you have
14:12 < larzconwell> Or you can just leave -j empty, and it won't limit the number of jobs running at the same time.
14:12 < niggler> just do make -j
14:13 < SomeoneWeird> orly
14:13  * SomeoneWeird didn't know that either
14:13 < SomeoneWeird> :P
14:13 < niggler> also, make -j only helps if you have lots of parallel dependencies
14:13 < niggler> if you make a shitty makefile where A depends on B depends on C etc etc then -j does nothing
14:13 < larzconwell> +1
14:13 < xcat> But it doesn't hurt, right?
14:14 < niggler> no it doesn't hurt, but don't think of it as a panacea
14:14 < SomeoneWeird> not for compiling node :)
14:14 < SomeoneWeird> ya
14:14 < xcat> Does building the source give me everything I need?
14:14 < xcat> Like npm or whatever
14:14 < niggler> you might need to get the npm source
14:15 < xcat> Do "normal" people need npm?
14:15 < SomeoneWeird> yes
14:15 < SomeoneWeird> the source comes with npm
14:15 < SomeoneWeird> its in ./deps
14:15 < niggler> https://github.com/isaacs/npm
14:15 < niggler> theres a separate repo
14:15 < SomeoneWeird> it'll automatically install it niggler 
14:15 < syskk> how do people typically detect XHR requests? is there a header to check for that
14:16 < niggler> https://github.com/joyent/node/tree/master/deps/npm ooh
14:16 < SomeoneWeird> :)
14:17 < xcat> Well we're off to a good start
14:17 < xcat>   File "./configure", line 355
14:18 < xcat>     1 if options.unsafe_optimizations else 0)
14:18 < xcat> SyntaxError: invalid syntax
14:18 < SomeoneWeird> use pastebin or something
14:18 < xcat> Oh shit, son, three lines better paste bin
14:18 < SomeoneWeird> -.-
14:18 < SomeoneWeird> what python v.?
14:19 < larzconwell> No reason to be rude, we didn't know how many lines there were.
14:19 < xcat> 2.4.3
14:19 < SomeoneWeird> ^^
14:19 < SomeoneWeird> got gcc etc. installed?
14:19 < xcat> Actually not sure on this box heh
14:19 < xcat> Probably not
14:20 < SomeoneWeird> :)
14:20 < xcat> Forgot I wasn't on my personal box
14:20 < xcat> What do you need to install on EL5?
14:21 < xcat> Not that g++ should be needed to run configure
14:21 < SomeoneWeird> will be needed to install though
14:21 < SomeoneWeird> idno, gcc, g++, openssl, curl etc.
14:21 < larzconwell> Nah I don't think it's due to something not being installed, it was a syntax error
14:22 < xcat> Yeah Python doesn't like it
14:22 < SomeoneWeird> still he needs them installed
14:22 < sam1_> minicom is working fine however node-serialport just will not output messages.. anyone fancy helping? its like 4 lines of code
14:22 < larzconwell> Yeah true, I think Node ships with a patched openssl, is it still needed?
14:23 < SomeoneWeird> not that I know of
14:23 < SomeoneWeird> hm
14:23 < SomeoneWeird> maybe
14:23 < larzconwell> xcat, what is on line 355 for you?? On Master it's just a function declaration.
14:23 < xcat> larzconwell: it's shown on the error
14:23 < xcat> 1 if options.unsafe_optimizations else 0)
14:23 < larzconwell> Okay I was just making sure that was correct.
14:23 < xcat> Yes, that is line 355
14:24 < SomeoneWeird> else 0) < valid python?
14:24 < xcat> It's part of a previous line
14:24 < xcat>   o['variables']['node_unsafe_optimizations'] = (
14:24 < larzconwell> The full line there is "(\n    1 if options.unsafe_optimizations else 0)"
14:24 < larzconwell> It's actually on line 405-406
14:25 < xcat> I'm just running the version of configure that's in the source download on the website
14:25 < xcat> http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.14/node-v0.8.14.tar.gz @ http://nodejs.org/download/ 
14:25 < larzconwell> I should probably use that as well then.
14:25 < SomeoneWeird> i literally just downloaded and compiled that myself
14:25 < SomeoneWeird> and it worked fine for me
14:27 < larzconwell> Just worked for me as well wtf.
14:27 < xcat> I have Python 2.4.3
14:27 < syav1991> Need some help with a "session not defined" error in Jade... Absolute beginner...
14:27 < SomeoneWeird> i have python 2.7
14:27 < larzconwell> I have 2.7 as well.
14:27 < xcat> :(
14:28 < SomeoneWeird> could possibly be that
14:28 < SomeoneWeird> anyway im out, gn all
14:30 < larzconwell> syav1991,  Did it include a stack trace or anything? 
14:30 < larzconwell> xcat, Can you update to 2.7 or no? That has to be the problem.
14:30 < syav1991> larzconwell: https://gist.github.com/a495bd938bd335267da4 Is this what you need?
14:30 < larzconwell> Yep that's fine thanks
14:31 < superjoe> what version of node is streams 2 going to land in?
14:31 < xcat> larzconwell: I don't know how to on CentOS
14:31 < xcat> I'm guessing 2.4 is considered the stable on this release
14:32 < Industrial> Nexxy: Where can I find the defenition of Stream#write/end ?
14:32 < xcat> I can install python26 package it seems
14:34 < larzconwell> Yes, you can do that. Change the shebang in the configure script to "/usr/bin/env python26", hopefully it's not a syntax error in 2.6 :D
14:35 < xcat> Yeah it was already installed heh
14:35 < larzconwell> Ah awesome
14:35 < xcat> Didn't realise multiple versions were installed concurrently
14:36 < syav1991> larzconwell: Any ideas?
14:36 < xcat> Python language seems like such a mess of backwards incompatibilities
14:36 < larzconwell> Yeah hold I think I got it.
14:36 < xcat> larzconwell: python26 worked
14:36 < syav1991> larzconwell: Thanks very much... Sorry to disturb, you're clearly handling a lot of people...
14:36 < larzconwell> xcat Okay great! Hopefully everything else works fine (:
14:37 < larzconwell> syav1991,  Nah don't worry about it, it's fine!
14:37 < xcat> 'node_install_waf': 'true', ... what's waf?
14:37 < syav1991> larzconwell: :-)
14:39 < larzconwell> syav1991,  On line 11 where you have "select(id="location",name="location")!=" what's the reason for the "!=" part? Did you want that to be outputted HTML, or to execute in Jade?
14:41 < syav1991> larzconwell: Umm... The point was to make a drop-down menu... The code is here: https://gist.github.com/a495bd938bd335267da4
14:41 < syav1991> So, the page looks like, there is a small drop down menu, from where the user selects the location
14:42 < syav1991> Followed by a small text box for entering text.
14:42 < larzconwell> syav1991,  But really that's not were your error occurs at, it's somewhere were you're calling "session" but you haven't included it as a param to compile.
14:42 < syav1991> Back end, I query the database for the search term, filtering results by location...
14:43 < larzconwell> syav1991,  Sorry about that

14:44 < cdown> Is it normal that net.Socket.on("disconnect", ...) isn't called by net.Socket.end()? If so, how should one manually trigger that handler?
14:45 < azbyin> hi all
14:45 < azbyin> why is;t node.js finding the modules i have installed with sudo npm install ... -g  ?
14:46 < xcat> Compiling v8 seems to take forever
14:46 < syav1991> larzconwell: I'm not quite sure I understand. I can't see where I have any use for session, so I can't get where the error could be... It's supposed to work like google, people can search without logging in, but if they log in later, THAT'S when I'll have any use of session at all...
14:46 < azbyin> they are available in /usr/lib/node_modules/
14:46 < larzconwell> syav1991,  Can I see you're full template code? You can PM it to me if you'd like.
14:47 < syav1991> template code = layout.jade, am I right? :-/ #noob
14:48 < larzconwell> Yeah just send the file you're having errors with currently, the one with this snippet https://gist.github.com/a495bd938bd335267da4 or is that all of it? If so send me that layout file.
14:48 < syav1991> larzconwell: That file is all of it... I can send the layout.jade file in another gist...
14:48 < larzconwell> syav1991,  Please, thank you
14:49 < larzconwell> azbyin,  where is the node executable living at? You can do "which node" to find out
14:49 < syav1991> larzconwell: 
14:49 < syav1991> Sorry...
14:50 < syav1991> Here is my layout.jade file: https://gist.github.com/954e78c46158007c0e34

14:50 < syav1991> As you can see, there are buttons on the top left and right...
14:50 < syav1991> And I've done the check for user here..

14:50 < syav1991> If he is signed in, then details show on top...
14:50 < syav1991> Else, it displays links to sign in and all...
14:51 < larzconwell> Okay here's the problem, on line 11 of your layout template you're calling "-if(session.user)" which is assuming there's a session object, but you're not including one(even if the user isn't signed in, just include an empty user object so it doesn't error out). 
14:52 < doki_pen> I'm piping the output from a spawned process's stdout over and http response using the on('data') event. I'm closing the response on('end'). Very rarely, I'm not getting the complete data on the http client. Is there some possible race condition where I can receive the on('end') event before I'm done writing the chunk to the response?
14:54 < syav1991> larzconwell: Umm... I understood what you said... But, code-wise, please let me verify... I should go to all places in my app.js where this jade page is called and write
14:54 < syav1991> res.render('search/index', {session:req.session.user});
14:54 < syav1991> Is that right?
14:55 < syav1991> That would send the session object, am I correct?
14:55 < syav1991> And an empty object if user is not signed in?
14:56 < larzconwell> Yes it would but if "req.session.user" is undefined, you'll need to send an empty object so the Jade compiler doesn't freak out. So what you can do is "res.render('search/index', {session:req.session.user || {}});"
14:56 < xcat> So, funny thing, make -j 4 causes my box to freeze
14:56 < larzconwell> Ha wow, have you tried compiling without J?
14:56 < xcat> Am now
14:57 < mscdex> doki_pen: for child processes you want to listen for the 'close' event to know when to end the http response
14:57 < doki_pen> oh, I actually typo'd above, I'm using the exit even. close is better?
14:57 < mscdex> doki_pen: for node 0.6.x i think it's the 'exit' event
14:57 < doki_pen> I'm on 0.8.14
14:58 < mscdex> doki_pen: things changed a bit in node 0.8.x, 'exit' no longer means streams are terminated, 'close' was added to signal this
14:58 < mscdex> doki_pen: http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_close
14:58 < doki_pen> mscdex: thanks, I'll try that out and see if it fixes things
15:03 < mdedetrich> im really glad that node did something
15:03 < mdedetrich> about their retarded domain handling issues
15:03 < mdedetrich> with domains
15:03 < mdedetrich> spent all night trying to figure it out
15:03 < mdedetrich> until I came across them
15:04 < Nom-> Hey guys.. looking to leverage Node.JS to do some web socket stuff (possibly with Faye or Socket.IO), however I want to integrate it with an existing site... ideally I don't want to be using non-standard ports (which can cause firewall issues for people), so are there any options like a Node.JS reverse proxy, or a reverse proxy that works with web sockets?
15:05 < syav1991> larzconwell: Well, I think what you suggested works, but there's another problem now... The browser displays another Reference error, saying that "flash" is not defined... When I comment out lines 31 and 32 from here: https://gist.github.com/954e78c46158007c0e34 (my layout.jade) it renders the page, but not completely... The buttons on the top are coming, but the drop down and search box aren't... A little more help, please???
15:05 < `3rdEden> HAProxy, or the Nodejitsu HTTP- proxy https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy Nom-
15:06 < mdedetrich> haproxy is probably the best performance proxy you will fiind
15:08 < larzconwell> syav1991,  Ah it seems the same thing is going on with "flash" you can just send an empty object when no flash is available. I'll see what I can do to help although I'm not to good with front-end stuff.
15:08 < syav1991> larzconwell: Thank you so much... Let me try that and see if that works... :-)
15:10 < Nom-> `3rdEden: Ahhh. searched for it secifically and found something useful... so basically you grab a subdomain and use that?
15:10 < `3rdEden> Nom-: subdomains would work as well
15:11 < `3rdEden> Nom-: idk what transports you want to use, but you should probably make sure they work cross domain then
15:11 < Nom-> Well, the short answer is ... as many transports as possible :)

15:13 < nedbat> i'm a node.js newb, on ubuntu I installed the nodejs package, and got a "nodejs" command.  Others around me seem to have a "node" command, what's the right way on ubuntu to get a "node" command?
15:14 < syav1991> larzconwell: Sorry, but quick question... How could I send the flash object as well as the session object to the jade page??? I tried res.render('search/index', {session:req.session.user || {}}, {flash:req.flash || {}}); but it's giving a TypeError...
15:17 < larzconwell> syav1991,  Here's what you can do: https://gist.github.com/4039398 The problem you're having is your putting the flash key/value in a different object than the params go in. 
15:18 < larzconwell> syav1991,  The params for the template should go in the 2nd argument of the render function, so you should put the params("session" and "flash") all in one object.
15:19 < syav1991> I see!!! So one cannot send in multiple objects in render, it always has to be a single one???
15:19 < syav1991> Let me try this out and get back to you... Thanks!!!
15:21 < larzconwell> Yeah it's just a single object, but in that object you can include objects as the values to keys so you can send this as params: "{adInfo: {name: "ad name", url: "https://ads.com"}}"
15:21 < larzconwell> then in the template you can call adInfo.name and stuff like that.
15:26 < syav1991> larzconwell: In your gist, you've used res.session and res.flash... I was getting a TypeError, but when I replaced it with req, it works... Thanks a million for this!!!
15:26 < larzconwell> Oh yeah that's my bad (: Sorry about that, I'm glad I could help!
15:27 < syav1991> larzconwell: I've gotta get back to this... Deadline in a few days... But thanks very much for this!!! I appreciate it!!! :_-)
15:27 < larzconwell> syav1991,  You're welcome! Have fun :D
15:28 < syav1991> larzconwell: I will!!! Thanks again!!! Good Night!!! (At least, it's night where I am ^_^)

15:32 < Tobsn> is there any easy way to unit test node.js apps - maybe with testem - all i need is to test the routing and responses of a simple app
15:33 < darjeeling> I wondered that!
15:33 < doki_pen> mscdex: that seems to have fixed it, thank you
15:33 < thl0> anyone using node-inspector@beta?

15:47 < xcat> Are there docs for v8?
15:47 < xcat> Usage docs rather than compilation
15:47 < guor> like what? ECMAscript spec?
15:48 < guor> or do you mean docs for embedding?

16:11 < ack006> hi all, i've noticed that current node dev version no longer includes node-waf. what's the plan on converting modules to use node-gyp?

16:17 < xcat> guor: ECMA script, yes
16:17 < xcat> I mean Mozilla has added tons of shite to JS in their browser so I imagine V8 has its own nuances
16:17 < xcat> Unless you mean to tell me it is 100% spec compliant
16:19 < xcat> I don't even know which version of ECMAScript V8 uses but are there docs for it or not?
16:20 < guor> xcat: V8 implements ES5
16:20 < guor> with some ES6 features (not yet standardized)
16:20 < guor> there are only very few stuff that are not part of any spec
16:20 < guor> like, google for "v8 stack trace api"
16:21 < guor> there are some more stuff interesting for embedders
16:21 < guor> but as to javascript code, it should be compatible to ES5 in large parts
16:22 < xcat> Where are the best ES5 docs?
16:22 < guor> http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm
16:23 < xcat> By best I mean easy to browse
16:23 < guor> oh. hm. I'd start with some javascript tutorial
16:24 < xcat> I know JS inside out, why would I want a tutorial
16:24 < xcat> I just want some ES5 docs that are as easy to use as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference
16:24 < guor> then I don't think you need anything else
16:24 < xcat> IF ES5 == JavaScript 1.8.5 then I can just use this
16:25 < guor> there are some minor differences, but the basic features are the same
16:25 < guor> V8 doesn't have E4X, for example
16:25 < guor> or generators
16:26 < FunnyLookinHat> Would anyone here mind looking over a quick chat app I wrote to tell me if I'm writing code like an idiot or if it seems to look right?  :)
16:26 < FunnyLookinHat> It'
16:26 < cait-ar> using node-ffi, I need to call a function which takes a pointer-to-pointer-to-struct, the routine deals with allocation of the structure and sticks it in that, pretty common in C -- the problem is I can't figure out how to do this, I don't think it's actually happening as expectedd
16:27 < xcat> E4X is one of the most horrible ideas ever conceived anyway
16:27 < guor> there's no typed arrays baked into the engine, but there is an implementation in the d8 shell
16:28 < nedbat> i'm a node.js newb, on ubuntu I installed the nodejs package, and got a "nodejs" command.  Others around me seem to have a "node" command, what's the right way on ubuntu to get a "node" command?
16:28 < cait-ar> compile from source
16:28 < guor> nedbat: download the sources and compile by yourself
16:28 < xcat> ln -s nodejs node?
16:28 < gildean> nedbat: add the newer repo and install from there
16:29 < gildean> or add a symbolic link between node and nodejs
16:30 < nedbat> thanks, one co-working has an entry in /etc/alternatives, does that change any of your answers?
16:31 < cait-ar> ubuntu's node.js package seems to be kind of crap, probably better off just building from source
16:31 < cait-ar> last I checked it didn't install npm

16:33 < brianc> nedbat: highly recommend compiling from source. it's very easy but if you're struggling, send me a direct message and I"ll walk you through it step by step
16:37 < AviMarcus> Hiya. Am I just being obtuse? How do I use node-unzip to get the file data, without having to save it to disk first? It says it's an example of pullstream but I don't see an actual example of streaming the data, only the meta-data
16:37 < nedbat> brianc: thanks, i can manage, just didn't know if I was missing the "correct" path.
16:37 < AviMarcus> (for ref: https://github.com/nearinfinity/node-unzip)
16:39 < FunnyLookinHat> nedbat, If you're on Ubuntu- you should add the node PPA and then install:  read the ubuntu instructions here: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
16:39 < xcat> How do you include other files?
16:40 < FunnyLookinHat> nedbat, Otherwise you'll hvae something sorely out of date, but you definitely DON'T need to be compiling from source.
16:41 < nedbat> FunnyLookinHat: thanks
16:41 < FunnyLookinHat> hopefully it'll save you quite a bit of time  :)
16:43 < nedbat> FunnyLookinHat: it has already worked!  thanks again.
16:51 < Tobsn> hmm i just recently switched to zsh and now it cant find the global node_modules folder, anyone know how to fix that?
16:51 < _fr_> Pour les francophones, toute la communauté node est désormais ici --> #node.js-fr. Les modules des auteurs francophones publiés sur npm, et tous les meilleurs articles de blogs vous sont notifiés automatiquement! Bonnes discussions.
16:52 < CoverSlide> Tobsn: in your ~/.npmrc folder, have this line: prefix=/path/to/global/dir
16:53 < CoverSlide> Tobsn: usually it's /usr or /usr/local
16:53 < Tobsn> export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node"
16:53 < Tobsn> i thought about just adding that to the zshrc
16:53 < CoverSlide> although it should default to node's prefix
16:54 < CoverSlide> you could do that
16:54 < CoverSlide> not sure what would be different from your other shell
16:54 < Tobsn> hmm its still not finding chai
16:54 < CoverSlide> Tobsn: are you using require('chai')
16:54 < Tobsn> yep
16:55 < jocafa> did you jiggle the cable?
16:55 < CoverSlide> you can't require global modules that way
16:55 < Tobsn> since when?
16:55 < CoverSlide> modules can only be locally detected
16:55 < CoverSlide> since npm 1.x
16:55 < Tobsn> wtf..
16:55 < Tobsn> so how do i include globals now?
16:55 < CoverSlide> you can use npm link
16:56 < Tobsn> ah right
16:56 < Tobsn> i remember reading about that
16:56 < CoverSlide> https://npmjs.org/doc/faq.html#I-installed-something-globally-but-I-can-t-require-it
16:58 < Tobsn> if i execute npm link module outside a folder, can i pass the target folder somehow?
16:58 < Tobsn> like npm link module libs/
16:58 < Tobsn> or something
16:58 < CoverSlide> Tobsn: https://npmjs.org/doc/link.html
16:58 < Tobsn> ah yeah im on it right now
16:58 < Tobsn> just poped open ;)
17:00 < Tobsn> hmm yeah thats confusing
17:05 < Tobsn> nice
17:05 < Tobsn> CoverSlide, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1656816/Screenshots/~~4n2qe8nxc7.png
17:05 < Tobsn> got it to work, thanks ;)
17:14 < DaMorpheuS> does someone knows how I can declare my API in a different file then my startup file I tried include but that doesn't work and require can't be used unless you assign it to a var..
17:16 < CoverSlide> DaMorpheuS: what do you mean "declare my API" ?
17:17 < defunctzombie> @isaacs hey, what do you think about pulling inherits into a module in core? instead of pushing everything into 'utils' pull out some of the more widely used modules. It would still ship with node, but just be a separate module
17:17 < RLa> "require can't be used unless you assign it to a var" <- that is wrong
17:18 < DaMorpheuS> app.get("/", blabsldasjdb)
17:18 < DaMorpheuS> locations declaration
17:18 < defunctzombie> I find that when I package stuff up for client side, I don't want to pull in 'utils' but would like it to be more specific
17:18 < RLa> require('something')(app) would work very well
17:18 < defunctzombie> this gets away from utils being a dumping ground
17:18 < xcat> It seems like my node.js socket is not pumping data as fast as it's coming in
17:19 < DaMorpheuS> so RLa I can say for example require('./routes.js')(app)
17:22 < RLa> yes you can
17:23 < RLa> reqire is just a function, nothing else
17:24 < Tobsn> hey, can someone tell me how i define a schema in mongoose if i dont know the child elements of one key? kinda like { parent: { n: [ [ name: String, id: Int ], [ name: String, id: Int ], ... ] } }
17:24 < Tobsn> i dont know how many children and how many arrays of name/id they have in them
17:28 < AviMarcus> Help please..? Am I just being obtuse? How do I use node-unzip to get the file data, without having to save it to disk first? It says it's an example of pullstream but I don't see an actual example of streaming the data, only the meta-data (for ref: https://github.com/nearinfinity/node-unzip)

17:32 < Industrial> I'm not understanding streams complretely yet. I wanted a stream that would emit events for HTTP requests and another to change the request data before ending the request. https://gist.github.com/92c72254b655baaf257c
17:32 < Industrial> This does nothing :(

17:47 < mdedetrich> CoverSlide: nonsense!
17:48 < CoverSlide> (net|http)servers don't emit or receive data, they make sockets which emit/receive data
17:48 < CoverSlide> mdedetrich: what part of that is nonsense?
17:49 < CoverSlide> servers are more like stream "factories" than actual streams
17:49 < mdedetrich> it being 4:50 am here and bathing in sarcasm is a reason why that is nonsense
17:49 < mdedetrich> I should really get to bed
17:50 < CoverSlide> ok
17:50 < CoverSlide> because if not,
17:50 < CoverSlide> somebody gonna get a hurt

17:50 < mdedetrich> ooh, ooh, who is it?
18:29 < chovy> howzy
18:38 < heavysixer> dguttman: oh hai! 
18:40 < FunnyLookinHat> Would anyone here mind looking over a quick chat app I wrote to tell me if I'm writing code like an idiot or if it seems to look right?  :)
18:40 < FunnyLookinHat> https://github.com/funnylookinhat/nodejs-chat
18:53 < Kakera> is there anyone knowledgeable about npm's publishing guidelines?
18:56 < Kakera> I want to publish a module but I'm not sure if it would be legal to do so
18:56 < larzconwell> Well what would make it possibly illegal?
18:57 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: the scrolling mechanism is broken for me. when I write a new message it doesn't go to the bottom.
18:57 < Kakera> the fact that it technically breaks Valve's TOS
18:57 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, oh - I'll tweak that...  but in terms of server-side code in /libs/ - how does it look?
18:57 < larzconwell> Talking about the recent Linux beta? 
18:57 < Kakera> nope
18:58 < larzconwell> ohcibi, well I'm not sure better ping isaacs 
18:58 < Kakera> https://github.com/seishun/node-steam
18:58 < larzconwell> Oops sorry ohcibi, to Kakera 
18:59 < larzconwell> This breaks Steam TOS??
19:00 < Kakera> ...you may not, in whole or in part, ..., reverse engineer,...the Software or any software accessed via Steam without the prior consent...
19:00 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: it's allowing me to write html tags into the chat w/o being escaped.
19:00 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, wait seriously?  they should have been purged...  hmm checking
19:01 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, Oh - I forgot to re-add my sanitize stuff...  fixed.  :)
19:02 < Kakera> I'm not sure if it makes software based on software based on reverse engineering illegal though
19:02 < Kakera> especially considering that Valve are completely fine with OSW and all related projects
19:03 < larzconwell> Don't think so. 
19:03 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, and the scrolling seems to work for me... hmm...
19:03 < larzconwell> But it's better to be safe than sorry!
19:03 < larzconwell> But in all seriousness I doubt it would matter.
19:04 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: I just crashed your server from the browser.
19:04 < Kakera> whom should I bug about it?
19:05 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: run this in the console: `document.querySelector('.message-input').value='hi all'; document.querySelector('input[type=submit]').click()`
19:05 < Lando_Calrissian> I think you will be fine with the Steam TOS
19:05 < Lando_Calrissian> This is cool though
19:05 < Kakera> I'd also like to replace the current 'steam' package that hasn't been updated for almost a year
19:05 < chovy> can you do .click() like that natively?
19:05 < tnorris> chovy: yup.
19:05 < chovy> what about other events? like .submit()
19:05 < tnorris> in newer browsers.
19:05 < tnorris> yup
19:05 < chovy> ie8?
19:05 < tnorris> no idea.
19:06 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, ooh - good find.  How do you feel about the structure of the code in general though?  i.e. stuff in app.js libs/chat.js and libs/packets.js etc. etc. ?
19:09 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: file structure is simple to fillow. line 21,22 of chat.js. only `!= null` is necessary. type coercion and all.
19:11 < chovy> tnorris: i will give that a try
19:11 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: if I refresh from the "enter username" page, then it shows that "undefined has left the room" in the chat window.
19:13 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, oh duh - because I'm not checking if the nick was ever set.  Good catch
19:13 < chovy> tnorris: looks like querySelector only matches one element
19:13 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: np. did code review for new web devs at my last job.
19:13 < tnorris> chovy: yup. if you want an array of elements use querySelectorAll
19:13 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, it's much appreciated, I'll hopefully be writing something significantly more complex this weekend...  if you happen to see me posting bad code here don't hesitate to call me out  ;)
19:15 < chovy> tnorris: thanks
19:15 < tnorris> np
19:18 < dguttman> heavysixer: =)
19:18 < heavysixer> dguttman: where did you go after digi?
19:19 < yashodhan> Hello any one here who has worked on mongoosastic? 
19:19 < yashodhan> which is mongoose + elastical search.
19:21 < airtanah_> does anyone know what the difference in process.config.variables between target_arch and host_arch?
19:22 < airtanah_> if i have pre-compiled a module in 64 bit, which do i need to check?
19:22 < TehShrike1> isaacs: If npm is going to require all-lowercase usernames, it should at least call toLowerCase on all the input :-(
19:22 < CoverSlide> perhaps the arch that built it
19:22 < CoverSlide> I'm assuming for cross-compilation 
19:22 <@isaacs> TehShrike1: i think that'd be more surprising
19:22 < airtanah_> for example, nodejitsu reports target_arch = 32, and host_arch = 64
19:23 <@isaacs> TehShrike1: what if you happen to choose a name that's already taken, and can't figure out why?
19:23 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: I also think each user should have a message queue limit. the following is causing your server to freak out: `for (var i = 0; i < 1e3; i++) $('.message-input').val('hi all'); $('.chat-entry').submit()`
19:23 < airtanah_> does this mean they're running 32bit node on a 64 bit machine?
19:23 <@isaacs> TehShrike1: since /~TehShrike is a 404
19:23 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: sorry, this: `for (var i = 0; i < 1e4; i++) setTimeout(function() { $('.message-input').val('hi all'); $('.chat-entry').submit(); }, i);`
19:23 < TehShrike1> isaacs: case sensitivity in usernames is one thing, but disallowing uppercase letters is another
19:23 <@isaacs> TehShrike1: but maybe /~tehshrike is not
19:23 <@isaacs> TehShrike1: i also disallow uppercase letters in package names.
19:23 < TehShrike|Work> Sure, that's fine
19:23 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, is that because the events are happening too quickly or in too high of a number?
19:23 < TehShrike|Work> I can buy all that
19:24 < TehShrike|Work> But in a world where uppercase letters are disallowed, I feel that input should be automatically lowercased
19:24 < CoverSlide> isaacs: Haraka is uppercase
19:24 <@isaacs> CoverSlide: yes, some things were grandfathered in
19:24 < CoverSlide> s/is/has
19:24 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: ^ that's why we can't auto-lowercase
19:24 < TehShrike|Work> I'm not going to remember that yours is the one site where usernames are case sensitive, but my username doesn't contain uppercase letters
19:24 < ack006> hi all, just added a reader and c-l tool to use perf output with node-stackvis. try it out :-)
19:25 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: it's would be a safety mechanism so a single user doesn't flood the message board. I think it's important since you're backfilling the chat log when users log in
19:25 < TehShrike|Work> Because my username always contains uppercase letters :-P it's TehShrike
19:25 < TehShrike|Work> I always type it in with the same uppercase letters
19:25 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, Yeah good point - interestingly enough... running that code yields a 100% cpu on chrome but only about 4% on node 
19:25 < TehShrike|Work> I type it in the same way on every site, in case some of them are case sensitive
19:25 < TehShrike|Work> But also because it's the correct way to type my username ;-P
19:26 < syskk> weird, I can't find any documentation about layout in Express's documentation
19:26 < CoverSlide> syskk: express 3.0 no longer has layouts
19:26 < CoverSlide> syskk: it's all determined by the engines now
19:26 < syskk> CoverSlide: ahh ok. well I'm still using a layout and it works though
19:26 < syskk> CoverSlide: ok good
19:27 < airtanah_> @isaacs is there a way to list my npm tags?
19:27 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, yeah - I'm limiting the chat log to 10 entries, so it's not that bad... but the flooding is still an issue.
19:27 < tnorris> isaacs: TooTallNate helped me understand that ArrayBuffer's are not a native v8 data type. So I was wondering, since normal Buffers can be wrapped in Typed Arrays (which is why Array Buffers exist) should they be combined?
19:28 < LambdaDusk> uh, I dunno if this is the best place to ask, but I need articles/tutorials on the matter of single page apps with authorization... I mean apps that work mainly on the client with json communication, but with authentication and authorization - I don't know how to begin there
19:28 < tnorris> with ArrayBuffer's I mean.
19:29 < Kakera> didn't they want to move from Buffers to typed arrays in the future
19:29 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: i see.  yeah, for website login i guess that makes sense.
19:29 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: patch welcome.  https://github.com/isaacs/npm-www
19:30 < ack006> airtanah_: guess he's not in here
19:30 < Kakera> isaacs, did you see my question about Steam?
19:30 < ack006> airtanah_: if i may try to answer you: use `npm info <pkg> dist-tags`
19:30 < TehShrike|Work> isaacs: fair enough.  There are projects grandfathered in with uppercase characters, are there any existing usernames with uppercase letters?  Or have lowercase usernames been enforced from the beginning?
19:30 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: it looks like the msg queue in the browser doesn't clear after X lines. so msg flooding causes any attached browser to freak out.
19:30 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: there are several users with uppercase chars in their names.
19:30 < ack006> airtanah_: or `npm info <pkg> versions
19:31 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: but you can't re-auth on a new machine with uppercase letters
19:31 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: so they are coming around slowly but surely.
19:31 < airtanah_> ack006 thanks!
19:31 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: and there's a (currently manual, ugh) process of switching package ownership
19:31 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, Oh - so I should probably be pulling items > 100 or something like that out of the log window in the browser
19:31 < ack006> airtanah_: np :-)
19:31 <@isaacs> Kakera: no
19:31 <@isaacs> Kakera: what's up?
19:31 < airtanah_> that's better than curling registry.nmpjs.org
19:31 < Taurian> Hello, is it ok to post a link to a question I have on Stack Overflow?
19:31 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: yeah. having +10000 DOM elements screws with stuff.
19:31 < TehShrike|Work> isaacs: all righty then, I'll see if I can make that smoother without touching much
19:31 <@isaacs> Taurian: sure
19:31 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, ;)
19:32 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: i think routes/login.js is probably a good place to start.
19:32 < vicapow> Taurian: couldn't hurt
19:32 <@isaacs> TehShrike|Work: feel free to touch it plenty.  it likes to be touched.
19:32 < TehShrike|Work> isaacs: cool, thanks.
19:32 < Taurian> Ok thanks, let me know your thoughts: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13295824/how-do-you-emit-to-a-room-using-socket-io-over-udp-dgram
19:32 < Kakera> is npm okay with something like https://github.com/seishun/node-steam ?
19:32 < TehShrike|Work> :-D
19:32 < vicapow> OH in IRC " feel free to touch it plenty.  it likes to be touched."
19:33 <@isaacs> Kakera: what do you mean "npm okay with"?
19:33 < Kakera> it might be considered illegal under interpretations of Valve's TOS
19:33 <@isaacs> Kakera: oh.  i dunno.
19:33 <@isaacs> Kakera: ask valve :)
19:33 <@isaacs> Kakera: if they come to me citing some kind of violation or whatever, i might have to remove it.
19:34 < Kakera> oh, alright
19:34 <@isaacs> Kakera: but i'll direct them to https://npmjs.org/doc/disputes.html if they email me
19:34 <@isaacs> Kakera: or maybe i'll just cc you and you can work it out with them
19:34 < Raynos> I have a node process that's using too much memory
19:34 < Kakera> Valve have already shown their stance on reverse-engineering Steam by taking zero action against SteamRE
19:34 < Raynos> how do I inspect what is using the memory
19:34 <@isaacs> Kakera: ideally, they'd take it over and maintain it.
19:35 <@isaacs> Kakera: forgiveness > permissio
19:35 <@isaacs> *n
19:35 < Raynos> I tried heapdump but it doesn't show the part that's using the memory
19:35 < nlf> Raynos: i like memwatch's heapdiff objects
19:35 < nlf> it'll at least show you what object type is leaking
19:36 < Raynos> what is memwatch ?
19:36 < nlf> https://github.com/lloyd/node-memwatch#readme
19:36 < Raynos> Well ideally I want to use chrome's heap inspection
19:36 < Raynos> but the heapdumps are only a few megabyte
19:37 < nlf> ah, i've never tried using chrome's heap inspection for it
19:37 < nlf> node-inspector doesn't really work great any more
19:38 < Raynos> Well chrome's heap inspection is a matter of taking a heapdump and importing it into chrome
19:38 < FunnyLookinHat> Is there a better way to get the unix time than to do String(Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000)) ?
19:38 < FunnyLookinHat> well - ignore the string part...
19:38 < FunnyLookinHat> :)
19:39 < tnorris> FunnyLookinHat: Date.now();
19:40 < FunnyLookinHat> tnorris, oh... look at that.  thx!
19:40 < tnorris> np
19:45 < tnorris> isaacs: was doing some perf comparisons. initializing a new Buffer is about 4x's faster than initializing a new ArrayBuffer, and they can both be used with Typed Arrays. Is there a reason that ArrayBuffer isn't just an instance of Buffer?
19:47 < substack> tnorris: new buffers actually come out of a pre-allocated pool
19:47 < tnorris> substack: "pre-allocated pool"?
19:49 < nlf> i second that question..
19:49 < tnorris> substack: but large Buffers are still backed by their own SlowBuffer. And in the case of large Buffers they're more like 10x's faster than a large ArrayBuffer.
19:50 <@isaacs> tnorris: honestly... we don't use ArrayBuffers internally, so we don't care about them that much.
19:50 <@isaacs> tnorris: it's all about the Buffers
19:51 < visnup> isaacs: what about the benjamins?
19:51 < WorkKorefr> Hey
19:51 <@isaacs> tnorris: if you can make ArrayBuffer's faster, then awesome, but if not, meh.  something to fix later.
19:51 <@isaacs> visnup: those, too
19:52 < WorkKorefr> What are people up to in node.js?
19:52 < tnorris> isaacs: i'm saying, since they function the same with Typed Arrays, the quickest fix is to, sort of, ArrayBuffer = Buffer;
19:53 < WorkKorefr> Anyone working on any node.js projects?
19:53 < chilts> WorkKorefr: there is a huge amount of stuff out there, see npmjs.org for a load of packages
19:54 < chilts> all kinds of crazy projects happening, as well as pretty large commercial stuff (and everything in between)
19:54 < WorkKorefr> Thanks chilts. I was just wondering what people here personally were involved in at the moment
19:54  * chilts is writing a budgeting website at the moment
19:54 < WorkKorefr> I've just been dabbling with it, kinda cool stuff
19:54 < chilts> hosted on Heroku, using Postgres
19:54 < chilts> but also got projects on Nodejitsu and my own server
19:54 < substack> isaacs: I got that thing working despite crypto having a weird api and string return values https://github.com/substack/secure-peer
19:55 < WorkKorefr> Ah nice. So what particular feature of node.js are you making the most of with that?
19:55 < substack> no core modifications necessary
19:55 < chilts> WorkKorefr: expressjs :) (even though that's a package rather than a particular feature of Node.js)
19:55 < chilts> dunno, my mind just thinks in JavaScript these days
19:55 < WorkKorefr> Ahh okay. I'll check it out.
19:55 < WorkKorefr> I've been using nowjs
19:55 < chilts> cool
19:56 < WorkKorefr> Oooh... nice website for express... that always fills me full of intrigue :P
19:57 < AnonymousPrime> i've been working on browser based behavior testing with zombie and nodeunit
19:57 < WorkKorefr> What sort of behaviour are you testing for prime?
19:57 < AnonymousPrime> whatever the app does
19:57 < WorkKorefr> okay.... I'd better check out zombie :P
19:58 < AnonymousPrime> it's just a way to automate things you'd normally test by hand
19:58 < AnonymousPrime> a user signup and login form, for example
19:58 < WorkKorefr> Oh sweet.... that looks very cool
19:58 < AnonymousPrime> i'm pretty new to automated testing on the whole, so lot of learn as i go :)
19:59 < WorkKorefr> As a .NET developer I'm really curious about these other ways of doing things.
19:59 < AnonymousPrime> i'm a .net dev too
19:59 < WorkKorefr> Do your colleagues mostly suck too? hehe
19:59 < AnonymousPrime> ha, no
19:59 < WorkKorefr> Lucky
19:59 < AnonymousPrime> they are more invested in .net  than i am
20:00 < AnonymousPrime> but that's ok :)
20:00 < WorkKorefr> Wish that were the case at my place
20:00 < WorkKorefr> I wonder how they got in actually.
20:00 < WorkKorefr> The first guy started emitting HTML when I asked him to display some data in a list on the screen.... repeater anyone? sheesh.
20:01 < WorkKorefr> When I say that... I don't mean HTML started pouring out of his eyes
20:01 < AnonymousPrime> while on the topic of nodeunit, does anyone know if there's already an html-based reporter out there that mimics rspec's html output? with fancy UI for filtering passed, failed and pending tests?
20:01 < WorkKorefr> I've not heard of one, sorry Prime
20:02 < WorkKorefr> Do you use c9.io AnonymousPrime ?
20:02 < AnonymousPrime> no, sublime mostly for js work these days
20:03 < larzconwell> I find it hard to use web based editors, have to use the console for most of my work so it just doesn't fit in for me.
20:03 < WorkKorefr> Is that sublime text?
20:03 < AnonymousPrime> i'm with @larzconwell on that
20:03 < AnonymousPrime> and yes, sublime text
20:04 < WorkKorefr> Ah okay. c9.io has a console though, which is kinda cool. I basically don't own a server and am on a windows PC, so needed something to let me try out node.js without installing lots of stuff
20:04 < AnonymousPrime> node.js install on windows isn't much trouble
20:04 < WorkKorefr> Anyway, don't know if I'll use it beyond the mucking around I'm doing on there
20:05 < WorkKorefr> Yeah, I later found you could install on Windows. I read somewhere that it only worked on Linux... obviously should have investigated some more before signing up haha
20:07 < Kakera> a lot of modules don't work on Windows
20:08 < svya1991> larzconwell: Hey, Larz, got a while??? I'm still experiencing problems with the jade pages...
20:08 < WorkKorefr> ahh, thanks Kakera. This sorta thing sounds much better suited to Linux enivronments
20:09 < WorkKorefr> In a nutshell... what's the difference between json and jsonp
20:09 < WorkKorefr> ?
20:09 < AviMarcus> Help please..? How do I use node-unzip to get the file data, without having to save it to disk first? It says it's an example of pullstream but I don't see an actual example of streaming the data, only the meta-data (for ref: https://github.com/nearinfinity/node-unzip)
20:09 < AviMarcus> WorkKorefr, jsonp has a callback so you can call it cross-domain
20:09 < AviMarcus> if that means anything to you.
20:09 < WorkKorefr> ahhhhh - that explains everything!
20:09 < WorkKorefr> ... .... okay, slight exaggeration
20:09 < WorkKorefr> Thanks.
20:10 < larzconwell> svya1991,  Yeah I can help for a little bit
20:10 < shripadk> hello all, is total %cpu = %user + %nice + %sys + %iowait + %steal or just total %cpu = %user + %nice + %sys + %iowait ?
20:10 < AviMarcus> also.. any way to stream unzipping bzip2? it's a really large file but the bzip mods are old and don't install on latest nodejs
20:11 < AviMarcus> erm decompressing. I suppose it's not called unzipping.
20:11 < svya1991> Yeah, so remember what I had explained about the site working like Google??? Well, I have the layout.jade and the index.jade pages (the 2nd one is to display the search box with the drop down menu, remember the '!=" part you had asked about?) but the thing is that, now, none of those things are rendering...
20:11 < svya1991> Just the buttons on top are rendering, that's it...
20:12 < visnup> isaacs: are you working from joyent offices tomorrow?
20:12 < visnup> isaacs: we're going to show up in the morning and work out of there
20:13 < larzconwell> svya1991,  Do you still have a link to the index.jade file? I don't have it anymore
20:14 < svya1991> Yes, I'll get it in a minute... Was just generating the gists now...
20:16 < svya1991> larzconwell: https://gist.github.com/c64c6fae2c022740d5a4 is the layout file and https://gist.github.com/9dfeb52d3fb187b285ff is the search index page...
20:17 < WorkKorefr> Happy noding people! (I hope that doesn't mean anything else... :S)
20:18 < larzconwell> svya1991,  Now the drop down menu is on the layout file right?
20:18 < tuhoojabotti> when is node's birthday?
20:18 < chilts> every day :D
20:18 < chilts> well, it feels like it anyway
20:19 < mscdex> node.js rules!
20:19 < svya1991> larzconwell: No, the layout.jade file contains the code only for the buttons on the top... The search box and the drop down menu are in a file called index.jade, which in turn is in a folder called search... That's why on top, it says extends ../layout on the top...
20:20 < mscdex> AviMarcus: there's always child processes ;-)
20:20 < svya1991> larzconwell:  the index.jade file for the search thing is the 2nd gist...
20:20 < svya1991> This one: https://gist.github.com/9dfeb52d3fb187b285ff
20:21 < denysonique> >> 'one two three four '.match(/(\w+ )+/)
20:21 < purr> denysonique: (object) ['one two three four ', 'four ']
20:21 < larzconwell> Okay I get you're talking about the select statement as the drop down menu!
20:21 < denysonique> Anyone knows how can I get each word captured?
20:21 < svya1991> Umm, yes, sorry if I wasn't clear earlier... 
20:21 < larzconwell> It's fine just trying to ensure I understand perfectly
20:22 < tnorris> tuhoojabotti: first commit in the repo is: Mon Feb 16 01:02:00 2009
20:22 < svya1991> Like I said, it's all like Google... You know how in Google, even after searching, the bar on top remains, right??? Showing your name, and +Larz and all that??? That's why the code for the buttons on top are in layout.jade, because they
20:22 < svya1991> *they're ALWAYS there...
20:23 < larzconwell> I gotcha (:
20:23 < svya1991> But the search box itself, that comes only on the search page... That's why the drop down and search box are in a separate file that extends the layout.jade file located in ..
20:25 < mscdex> oh neat, gzip hardware cards
20:30 < AviMarcus> mscdex, ?
20:31 < AviMarcus> mscdex, it's not a speed/blocking issue, it just seems rather wasteful to decompress 15gb to disk when it will be only like 5gb inserted directly into a DB
20:33 < mscdex> right
20:35 < mscdex> AviMarcus: so spinning up a bzip2 process won't work?
20:35 < AviMarcus> (and it will chew the disk for 5-10 minutes at least)
20:35 < AviMarcus> mscdex, within node? I don't see any current bzip2 node code
20:35 < mscdex> AviMarcus: bzip2 _process_
20:35 < AviMarcus> it's all 1yr old and won't npm install
20:35 < mscdex> child process
20:35 < AviMarcus> hmm. Does it pip to stdout?
20:36 < AviMarcus> pipe* I didn't really look. 
20:36 < mscdex> bzcat does
20:36 < mscdex> bunzip2 might also
20:36 < Aartsie> hi all, is it possible to do script(src='users.js', type='text/javascript') in the body tag with jade 
20:37 < AviMarcus> hmm OK mscdex lemme run that down
20:37 < shripadk> Aartsie: yes
20:38 < Aartsie> shripadk: it don't work for me ? 
20:38 < AviMarcus> mscdex, while we are on it.. know how to use node's built in zip or https://github.com/nearinfinity/node-unzip to stream output of a .zip file? (non-disk) node-unzip is short on docs..
20:38 < shripadk> Aartsie: do you get an exception?
20:39 < Aartsie> shripadk: https://gist.github.com/bf592dac0f93d273ea98 this is what i do :) 
20:40 < shripadk> Aartsie: looks like your path is incorrect
20:40 < shripadk> script(src='/js/users/users.js', type='text/javascript')
20:41 < Aartsie> shripadk: ok i will try it
20:41 < Aartsie> shripadk: Still don't work it don't show up in the code 
20:43 < AviMarcus> mscdex, cool, bunzip2 -dc is the same as bzcat
20:43 < shripadk> Aartsie: your path is incorrect
20:44 < mscdex> AviMarcus: ah yeah, that makes sense :-)
20:44 < larzconwell> svya1991,  Okay I got it, the problem is the blocks you were making here's some background on how to use them fully. https://github.com/visionmedia/jade#a11 I'm gonna make some gists with my patches
20:44 < AviMarcus> unzip seems to have similar options
20:45 < shripadk> Aartsie: your public directory should have a js/users directory with the users.js file in it. else it will return a 404 Not Found
20:46 < Aartsie> shripadk: when i go to the url it works
20:46 < tracker1> tnorris, btw, narrowed down the error... seems to be in binding EventEmitter to process... https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4256
20:46 < svya1991> larzconwell: Many thanks... I'll wait...
20:46 < tracker1> I was using that for raising/handling certain errors...
20:47 < svya1991> larzconwell: Incidentally, I had gone through that page that you linked, that'
20:47 < svya1991> *that's how I knew about the extends keyword...
20:47 < svya1991> But I'm still not sure about the block...
20:47 < svya1991> *blocks...
20:47 < shripadk> Aartsie: do you have a overlay.jade?
20:48 < Aartsie> yes :) 
20:48 < shripadk> okay i don't see any reason as to why it would not work
20:48 < Aartsie> shripadk: it shows the hole page, but the script line don't
20:48 < larzconwell> Yeah it can be a bit weird at first, I'll try and make sure my code explains it
20:50 < shripadk> Aartsie: which version of jade are you using?
20:50 < svya1991> Thank you... I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time... It'll be embarasssing if it's a syntax thing... I tried to write my code after understanding the concept of block as best as I could...
20:50 < tnorris> TooTallNate: did some perf testing with buffer/arraybuffer after our conversation. buffer is faster in all accounts.
20:50 < tnorris> think it would be worth it to rewrite arraybuffer to inherit from buffer instead of using the current cpp implementation?
20:51 < TooTallNate> tnorris: i do
20:51 < Aartsie> shripadk: i have no idea, i have this on my express app.set('view engine', 'jade');
20:53 < shripadk> Aartsie: sorry no clue. it works on mine with your snippet.
20:56 < larzconwell> svya1991,  Here you go: https://gist.github.com/4041516 The main thing here is in the search template, note here the "block" before the names.
20:57 < Aartsie> shripadk: my jade version is jade@0.27.6
20:57 < tnorris> TooTallNate: shouldn't be difficult. only two things need to change. Docs say an array buffer must have "Its contents are initialized to 0" and expose byteLength, which is the same as Buffer.length.
20:57 < TooTallNate> tnorris: haha, nice
20:59 < tnorris> TooTallNate: bugger, didn't realize the "initialize to 0" part. no wonder buffer initialization is so much faster.
21:00 < Aartsie> shripadk: aha i got it i think it will be block by the ajax request
21:00 < TooTallNate> tnorris: don't forget to implement: "TypeError: Constructor cannot be called as a function."
21:01 < TooTallNate> when not called with "new"
21:01 < svya1991> larzconwell: I read through you code... BRB, let me try this out, and see what happens...
21:01 < larzconwell> Okay cool 
21:06 < s5fs> anyone at cascadiajs today?
21:07 < larzconwell> Everyone.
21:07 < s5fs> i see it's being streamed, that's cool
21:07 < s5fs> everyone but me, i guess. i'm waving from portland though
21:07 < larzconwell> I was just joking :D I've never been to a conference.
21:08 < s5fs> not even parent/teacher?
21:08 < larzconwell> Just once, I was a good kid. 
21:08 < s5fs> haha very good
21:13 < svya1991> larzconwell: I cannot possibly thank you enough!!! ^_^ Everything is rendering PERFECTLY!!! 
21:15 < svya1991> Wow, thanks a million, man, larzconwell ... Sorry to keep bugging you repeatedly, but this is for a college project, and I don't really have much experience with web-tech... I've mostly just worked with C++ and Java, nothing web-related, though...
21:16 < svya1991> larzconwell: I thought that the "block" thing worked likt <head></head>
21:16 < svya1991> head and then block head :-/
21:16 < svya1991> Thanks for clearing that up ^_^ ...
21:17 < larzconwell> svya1991,  No it doesn't do anything really. You create a block with "block <name>" and then provide default content, when you use "block <name>" again it'll override the first one.
21:18 < larzconwell> svya1991,  I'm glad I could clear up those issues with you. 
21:19 < svya1991> Yes, I see that now... So, programming in Jade becomes a little like programming in Java, am I right??? You create an Abstract class, extend it in another class, and override the functions if you need to... Here, you create a base template, extend that, and then override various individual blocks... It's all clear now ^_^ ...
21:19 < larzconwell> uhmmmm, sure! :D Never programmed in Java, but that sounds about right.
21:20 < tnorris> TooTallNate: ah, yeah. forgot about that one. but bugger, the zero fill is making buffer instantiation about 50% slower.
21:21 < tnorris> have any ideas how to deal with that?
21:22 < nlf> fills are slow
21:32 < ivasilov_> does anyone know if I use sequelize.js chainer, can I use a result from first operation into the second one? 
21:32 < zcourts_> I'm send/receiving json between node and a java service and when I do buffer.toString('utf-8',4,size) I get the json followed by utf8 string "\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000", any idea why this happens?
21:34 < mscdex> zcourts: is size >= 4?
21:34 < mscdex> zcourts: i think you may want `4 + size`
21:35 < zcourts> mscdex, yes it is > 4
21:35 < zcourts> mscdex, I'll try that.
21:36 < mscdex> zcourts: otherwise, why are you needing to offset by 4?
21:37 < Kakera> is there a way to check whether a socket is dead?
21:38 < zcourts_> mscdex, no that doesn't work. the java side writes an int (4 bytes, size of message) followed by the message ( utf8 string converted to byte array)
21:38 < AviMarcus> ivasilov_, there's a sequalize channel btw
21:39 < ivasilov_> AviMarcus: thanks, I didn't know
21:41 <@isaacs> ircretary: tell visnup I'll be there around 4pm or so.  maybe a bit earlier.
21:41 < ircretary> isaacs: I'll be sure to tell visnup
21:41 <@isaacs> ircretary: thaks
21:41 < ircretary> isaacs: I'm not sure what to do with that command.  Ask for help in PM.
21:41 <@isaacs> ircretary: thanks
21:41 < ircretary> isaacs: You're welcome :)
21:42 < chapel> lol
21:42 < zcourts> mscdex, the utf8 appended seems to always be 8 bytes so if anything it'd be size - 8 but I can't see why its doing it
21:55 < pr0xy> how does the node.js module rewriting work?
21:56 < pr0xy> like /socket.io/socket.io.js and /library/library.js
21:56 < mscdex> zcourts: who knows, it's Java ;-)
21:56 < pr0xy> I have a node.js http proxy at port 80, that redirects localhost/n traffic to port 9000 (node) and localhost traffic to port 8080 (Apache/PHP)
21:56 < pr0xy> The problem is that library calls (which I think are handled by node) isn't working when I do that./
21:57 < pr0xy> http://localhost/n/socket.io/socket.io.js : 404 not found
21:57 < brettster> Does anyone have any good html tutorials
21:57 < brettster> ?
21:57 < brettster> I'm trying to make a layout.
21:57 < brettster> But my tables keep getting weird.
21:57 < othiym23> rando question: has anyone here used Opa?
21:57 < pr0xy> brettster: avoid tables, use css float:left
21:57 < pr0xy> height-weight
21:59 < brettster> meh
21:59 < brettster> css is for noobs
21:59 < chovy> brettster: don't use tables
21:59 < brettster> why>
21:59 < brettster> I read it's best practice
21:59 < chovy> heh
21:59 < brettster> to split tabular data with tables
21:59 < chovy> check the date on that article
22:00 < chovy> oh, for tabular data, sure
22:00 < chovy> you said layout
22:00 < pr0xy> it is best practice to use <table> for tables
22:00 < pr0xy> not for layout
22:00 < brettster> Wait
22:00 < brettster> <table> ?
22:00 < pr0xy> <div style='float:left;width:200px;height:100%'>Sidebar</div><div style='float:left'>Main content</div>
22:01 < brettster> Ah
22:01 < brettster> I've just been using <td>
22:01 < brettster> without the <table>
22:01 < pr0xy> -.-
22:01 < pr0xy> Plz don't use table for layout.
22:01 < brettster> Haha I
22:01 < brettster> I'm totally joking.
22:01 < brettster> guyz
22:01 < larzconwell> Yeah I got a couple tutorials for you: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp
22:01 < pr0xy> anyway, could anyone answer my proxy question?
22:01 < brettster> in all seriousness - I'm genuinely looking for a good tutorial on node
22:02 < brettster> not an introduction
22:02 < brettster> but from beginner to expert
22:02 < brettster> a book?
22:02 < brettster> does anyone have any recs?
22:02 < FunnyLookinHat> brettster, I haven't found one.... so if you do, share it here.  :)
22:02 < FunnyLookinHat> Felix's guide was a decent enough crash course in the "getting started" phase, and from there I just started writing stuff.
22:02 < brettster> Uh
22:02 < brettster> Okay
22:02 < larzconwell> I think Peepcode made a pretty good video series on full stack development with Node. Not sure how it is now though as fast as things change.
22:03 < pr0xy> brettster: do you know javascript?
22:04 < brettster> Yes
22:04 < coderarity> isaacs: is there some way to disable caching in st for development?
22:04 < pr0xy> you can start with jquery to learn about the "style" of passing functions around
22:04  * mscdex shakes a fist at jquery
22:05 < sinclair_> mscdex: you don't like jquery?
22:05 < mscdex> not really, no
22:05 < larzconwell> pr0xy,  "http://localhost/n/socket.io/socket.io.js : 404 not found" I think this can be solved by including the port on the host, but I'm not sure..
22:05 < sinclair_> mscdex: i like jquery
22:05 < chovy> mscdex: what's the problem?
22:06 < pr0xy> larzconwell: I have set up node-http-proxy at port 80
22:06 < pr0xy> To forward /n traffic to the actual node.js server
22:06 < pr0xy> And to forward all other traffic to Apache's port.
22:06 < pr0xy> I think node.js will ONLY return the npm library codes if there is no /n/
22:06 < larzconwell> Oh okay I see. I'm not sure how to get passed that.
22:07 < pr0xy> but /socket.io/socket.io.js gets passed to Apache :(
22:07 < bingomanatee> See you all at NodeKnockout.js
22:08 < bingomanatee> See you at the Team WonderlandLabs oxygen tent and grill!
22:08 < pr0xy> Got a XSS bingomanatee question
22:08 < AviMarcus> mscdex, thanks, the system call streaming seems to be working OK
22:08 < pr0xy> can I put socket.mysite.com scripts in www.mysite.com
22:08 < AviMarcus> via child_process.spawn I get on('data') events
22:08 < pr0xy> and make it connect to the node.js server on socket.mysite
22:09 < pr0xy> without browsers blocking it
22:09 < bingomanatee> sure
22:09 < bingomanatee> I think.
22:09 < pr0xy> cool!
22:09 < other_guy> I'm having a CRAZY fucking terrible time dealing with the prototypal inheritance situation for a use case I'm dealing with… is anyone here super confident in that whole mechanism that might be able to lend a hand?
22:09 < bingomanatee> Socket is after all an amalgam of cometesque techniques. Whether "Socket" works depends on whether the transmission service you have chosen works. For instance if you can do it with flash you can do it with socket.
22:10 < bingomanatee> other_guy throw it on gist.github.com
22:10 < pr0xy> bingomanatee: I don't think I can do it with flash actually
22:10 < pr0xy> Blocks crossdomain requests.
22:10 < pr0xy> Including subdomain ones.
22:10 < pr0xy> So socket.blah.com can't communicate with blah.com
22:10 < shripadk> pr0xy: supply cross domain.xml
22:10 < pr0xy> cross domain.xml?
22:10 < pr0xy> Oh wow
22:10 < pr0xy> THanks!
22:10 < other_guy> bingomanatee, it's here… https://github.com/Coradine/chinood/blob/master/index.js#L52
22:11 < CoverSlide|TPFR> What's crackin' ? Who ya mackin' ? Whatcha doin' ? Who ya screwin' ? 
22:11 < pr0xy> you are awesome :D
22:11 < other_guy> it gets used like this...
22:11 < shripadk> pr0xy: for flash sockets to work cross domain
22:11 < shripadk> :)
22:11 < other_guy> https://github.com/Coradine/chinood/blob/master/test/models/my_model.js#L28
22:11 < bingomanatee> proxy I can't help but notice you are changing the Chinod object and not Chinod.prototype
22:12 < other_guy> where, you mean here… Chinood.BaseModel.apply(this, arguments);
22:12 < other_guy> ?
22:13 < bingomanatee> sorry.
22:13 < bingomanatee> Id suggest that if you are going to to that you might as well have it as a local variable.
22:13 < other_guy> the problem I'm having is that everytime I create a "new" model
22:13 < other_guy> it's sharing the prototype of all the other ones
22:14 < other_guy> so...
22:14 < bingomanatee> can you put up BaseModel?
22:14 < bingomanatee> that is what a prototype is for.
22:14 < syskk> do you guys commit your node_modules directory when not writing a library?
22:14 < bingomanatee> If you want to create things without shared prototypes, create new objects in a factory.
22:15 < other_guy> https://gist.github.com/f3be9b8fe5c25237ac4e
22:15 < bingomanatee> syskk: its a good practice to keep the exact environment intact in Git
22:15 < bingomanatee> i.e., to not have carryover from prototype, return {foo: 1, bar: 2} etc.
22:15 < syskk> bingomanatee: good. what if I modules that are symlinked though? (through npm link)
22:15 < nlf> i prefer to not have node_modules in the repo
22:16 < other_guy> bingomanatee, https://github.com/Coradine/chinood/blob/master/lib/base_model.js
22:16 < syskk> i think im going to just commit my node_modules, its really a pain sometimes fighting with npm install bugs
22:16 < other_guy> This is driving me bananas, it was all much better when the models were their own defined classes, except for that property creation happened upon each instantiation, and was slower than hell when you needed to get a lot of them or you had large objects.
22:16 < chovy> syskk: commit them?
22:17 < syskk> yea, that's what  I will do
22:17 < syskk> I'm just wondering about my symlinked modules though
22:17 < pr0xy> ok, so how do I serve /socket.io/socket.io.js
22:17 < pr0xy> what is the actual file
22:17 < svya1991_> larzconwell: Another small issue, it's regarding the sessions and jade, again... Bother you for a while???
22:17 < chovy> are you modifying node_modules/ ?
22:17 < pr0xy> I don't see it in my folder.
22:17 < other_guy> which is what lead me to opt for this define the prototype once scenario, but it's proving to be fraught with pitfalls
22:17 < pr0xy> chovy: it's there? I don't see socket.io.js in node_modules
22:18 < pr0xy> I have a proxy that sends localhost/n to node.js/socket.io
22:18 < pr0xy> localhost/n/socket.io/socket.io.js gives 404
22:18 < shripadk> pr0xy: is socket.io working normally (without a proxy)?
22:18 < chovy> i had problems with commit node_modules. I added it to .gitignore
22:18 < pr0xy> shripadk: yes
22:18 < chovy> and run npm install everytime i deploy.
22:18 < shripadk> pr0xy: whats the path?
22:19 < shripadk> pr0xy: u sure you have configured node-http-proxy properly
22:19 < shripadk> ?
22:19 < syskk> chovy: what about `npm linked packages? 
22:19 < pr0xy> I'm not sure
22:19 < pr0xy> But traffic does get passed through
22:19 < pr0xy> Just not library files
22:19 < pr0xy> my setup:
22:19 < pr0xy> node-http-proxy at port 80, passes /n/... to port 9000, passes everything else to port 8000
22:19 < syskk> is there an alternative to npm link that doesn't rely on symlinks?
22:19 < pr0xy> 8000 is apache
22:20 < shripadk> pr0xy: localhost/n goes to node except for the mobiles stuff?
22:20 < tnorris> tracker1: think I tracked down the bug, though waiting for confirmation from piscisaureus_ or anyone else who understands node internals better than me.
22:20 < pr0xy> shripadk: yes, it goes to node except for npm modules's js
22:20 < larzconwell> svya1991_,  Yep
22:20 < shripadk> pr0xy: weird.. that shouldn't be happening..
22:21 < shripadk> pr0xy: unless node-http-proxy isn't parsing the path properly
22:21 < pr0xy> hmm
22:21 < pr0xy> I'll paste it
22:21 < pr0xy> pastebin(*
22:21 < tracker1> tnorris, saw that.. :)
22:21 < svya1991_> Well, I'm getting the same "Session is not defined" issue, but this time I've narrowed it down to line 4 in the app.js code snippet here: https://gist.github.com/30e087c68f1690c06623
22:21 < pr0xy> shripadk: http://pastebin.com/BwvP8BR6
22:21 < tnorris> tracker1: can't believe the problem comes from that single line.
22:22 < svya1991_> It's something in the way that I'm using that locals thing, right???
22:22 < pr0xy> this is the snippet of the proxy code
22:22 < larzconwell> svya1991_,  Ping me it's a bit busy in here
22:22 < larzconwell> PM*
22:22 < tracker1> tnorris, it's kinda weird.. may just be some unintended consequences of the domain support
22:22 < pr0xy> Do I need to do anything special in handler?
22:23 < tracker1> should probably be   this.domain = this.domain || null
22:23 < Raynos> What's the correct place to ask for help with mdb & v8.so ?
22:23 < tracker1> mdb?
22:23 < Raynos> is it here or somewhere else?
22:23 < tracker1> Raynos, like ms-access?
22:23 < Raynos> smartos's modular debugger
22:24 < chilts> maybe #libuv?
22:24 < shripadk> pr0xy: i think its better you route it manually by checking the path
22:24 < pr0xy> shripadk: oh god
22:24 < pr0xy> I just figured out why
22:24 < Kakera> under what circumstances will a socket object be garbage collected?
22:24 < pr0xy> localhost/n doesn't work, localhost/n/ works
22:24 < shripadk> pr0xy: seems like it does a catch all
22:24 < Raynos> Yeah #libuv or #joyent or #smartos
22:24 < pr0xy> -.-
22:24 < shripadk> weird :P
22:25 < shripadk> pr0xy: why don't you just parse it out yourself?
22:26 < pr0xy> shripadk: you mean not use http-proxy-server?
22:26 < syskk> what does npm do when you `npm install` two times?
22:27 < syskk> will it update packages that could be updated?
22:27 < shripadk> pr0xy: use it but check req.path yourself and route accordingly
22:30 < shripadk> pr0xy: i guess its req.url, req.path is for http requests
22:33 < shripadk> pr0xy: http://pastebin.com/j27XUBuG
22:34 < pr0xy> shripadk: thanks :)
22:34 < pr0xy> is there any reason for doing it this way through?
22:34 < shripadk> pr0xy: sorry typo
22:35 < shripadk> pr0xy: http://pastebin.com/q4GVdv9f
22:35 < shripadk> from what i can see node-http-proxy is doing catch all for localhost itself
22:35 < shripadk> so localhost/n matches both localhost/n and localhost
22:36 < pr0xy> okay, thanks again shripadk :) I really apperciate it
22:37 < shripadk> :)
22:37 < TooTallNate> tnorris: are you just calling this.fill(0)
22:37 < TooTallNate> ?
22:39 < chovy> syskk: i don't know what linked packages are
22:40 < chapel> chovy: you pinged me?
22:40 < chovy> chapel: yeah
22:40 < chovy> i was curious what your model looks like for voting on a card.
22:41 < chapel> well, we don't have votes on cards :P
22:41 < chapel> have highfives though
22:41 < chapel> and votes on links
22:41 < pr0xy> yes! I finally got what I want working :D
22:41 < chovy> i want to handle voting on my app...I'm thinking I either just increment/decrement a counter or I store a collection of votes, but then calculating up/down i'm not sure about.
22:41 < shripadk> pr0xy: :)
22:41 < chapel> congrats pr0xy
22:41 < chovy> chapel: it was links.
22:41 < astropirate> its great, our state has telepathic voting now. Advances in technology man..
22:42 < chapel> chovy: well, to put it simply, votes are a document in a collection
22:42 < chovy> do you guys actually store who voted and which direction, or do you just do item.votes++
22:42 < chapel> they have a score value, either 1, 0, -1
22:42 < chapel> 1 being up vote, 0 being no vote, -1 being down vote
22:42 < pr0xy> chovy: it might be worthwhile to use a database if you want it to be persistant
22:43 < chovy> pr0xy: yeah, i'm using mongodb
22:43 < pr0xy> ok, have two
22:43 < chapel> we also cache the score in the link document so we don't have to query the votes all the time
22:43 < pr0xy> a counter of how many votes it has
22:43 < pr0xy> and a collection of who voted
22:43 < pr0xy> increase the counter / decrease it everytime someone votes
22:43 < chovy> chapel: so you store something like item.votes.push({ user: user.id, vote: [-1|0|1]});
22:43 < chapel> no
22:44 < chapel> votes are a separate collection
22:44 < chovy> why do you do them as a separate collection?
22:44 < chapel> didn't really want to inflate the item document
22:44 < chovy> i see
22:45 < cellvia> when i pipe streams to each other, how can i pipe the errors as well ? this doesnt seem to be built in,  or custom events for that matter dont get piped either
22:45 < chovy> so to get the tally, you have to loop over all votes for an item and then display the total.
22:45 < cellvia> any ideas?
22:45 < chovy> how can someone do a vote of 0?
22:45 < chapel> chovy: by default there is no vote
22:45 < MI6> joyent/node: piscisaureus created branch winfix - http://git.io/0Y_b6w
22:46 < chapel> but if someone votes, it has either 1 or -1, but if they un-vote, then it would be 0
22:46 < chovy> how would i ever get into the votes collection if i didn't vote?
22:46 < chovy> oh, you can un-vote
22:46 < chovy> i see
22:46 < chapel> the cached value in the item document is accurate, and is updated on each vote
22:46 < ryanrolds_w> Anyone in here know a good cloud provider that has a fast (> 500Mb) vlan and isn't Joyent or Rackspace?
22:47 < shripadk> ryanrolds_w: cloudsigma?
22:47 < pr0xy> if I have a long execution code in a function
22:47 < ryanrolds_w> shripadk: Thanks looking at them.
22:47 < pr0xy> it will only block that function
22:47 < pr0xy> and not others right?
22:48 < cellvia> alternatively is there a way to see what pipes are subscribed / subscribers to a certain stream at that moment
22:48 < shripadk> pr0xy: it will block the process
22:48 < chapel> pr0xy: depends on what it is doing
22:48 < pr0xy> shripadk: so will it block another HTTP request, for example?
22:48 < chapel> yes
22:48 < pr0xy> it's sending a long stream of websockets
22:48 < shripadk> yes it will
22:48 < chapel> if it blocks the process, it will block everything
22:49 < chapel> streams are non-blocking
22:49 < pr0xy> chapel: I mean a stream as in a long while loop
22:49 < shripadk> it depends on how you are streaming it though
22:49 < chapel> why use a while loop?
22:49 < pr0xy> It's like IRC chat logs
22:49 < shripadk> yeah a while loop blocks the process for the period it runs
22:50 < chapel> lots of ways to handle that non-blocking
22:50 < chapel> could convert it to a stream and emit each line
22:50 < pr0xy> ok, so how do the non-blocking functions work? if something blocks everything, then are certain things nonblocking?
22:50  * sinclair__ notes, there is nothing wrong with synchronous code
22:50 < chapel> pr0xy: what are you doing with the irc chat logs for instance?
22:50 < chapel> sinclair__: sure there is :P
22:51 < pr0xy> Or does non-blocking just mean "after the execution of this function, node.js will be able to switch to a different one"
22:51 < chapel> blocking synchronous code is bad if you want other things to happen
22:51 < shripadk> pr0xy: there aren't any non-blocking "functions" in nodejs. its only non-blocking I/O
22:51 < shripadk> your confusion lies in mixing up functions with I/O
22:51 < sinclair__> chapel: no, no there isn't, one could argue that async io is a good or bad idea also (in the flavor of node)
22:52 < chapel> sinclair__: in the confines of node/v8 synchronous blocking code is bad
22:52 < chapel> unless it is meant to be run only in order like a script
22:53 < sinclair__> chapel: i would like to know the options for running process intensive script as a thread
22:53 < pr0xy> OK so for something like this https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-fibonacci/blob/master/fibonacci.js
22:53 < pr0xy> It's non-blocking because it only works for a certain amount of milliseconds
22:54 < chapel> sinclair__: node doesn't use threads for user code, only for i/o
22:54 < tnorris> TooTallNate: tried that and `this.parent.fill(this.offset, this.length + this.offset)` to skip a function call. either one is ~50% slower.
22:54 < sinclair__> chapel: you do need threads sometimes 
22:54 < chapel> sinclair__: examples?
22:55 < sinclair__> chapel: compiling 50 large source files with TypeScript
22:55 < TooTallNate> tnorris: slower then the current ArrayBuffer or slower than Buffer?
22:55 < chapel> sinclair__: can be done with processes as well
22:55 < pr0xy> Okay, so when does node.js switch execution to a different part of the code?
22:55 < tnorris> tracker1: don't know. but initializing and event emitter from another event emitter probably wasn't thought about. ;)
22:55 < sinclair__> chapel: well, i was thinking about spawning a child process
22:55 < shripadk> pr0xy: its blocking for the time it runs
22:55 < chapel> pr0xy: while will continue to block until it is done
22:56 < sinclair__> chapel: and writing back the compiled output on the stdout 
22:56 < pr0xy> ok, I see!
22:56 < chapel> you can make it recursive, which would allow other code to run between function calls
22:56 < pr0xy> So I can't make non-blocking things unless it's IO?
22:56 < pr0xy> Or make it recursive?
22:56 < tnorris> TooTallNate: `(new Buffer(0xFF)).fill(0)` is ~50% slower than `new ArrayBuffer(0xFF)`
22:56 < pr0xy> this sounds like actionscript 3.0 -.-
22:56 < sinclair__> chapel: that sounds like a really bad idea
22:56 < chapel> pr0xy: while blocks, full stop
22:56 < sinclair__> chapel: so i won't be doing that
22:56 < chapel> doing fibonacci is bad
22:57 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder winfix * 9b22944 : windows: fix the x64 debug build - http://git.io/Xv-K2A
22:57 < pr0xy> Got it!
22:57 < chapel> sinclair__: was talking to pr0xy
22:57 < chapel> sinclair__: you could use cluster for handling the processing as needed
22:57 < pr0xy> I'm going to read a few articles / stuff on node.js blocking
22:57 < shripadk> pr0xy: everything in node is like any other language… except the way I/O is done
22:57 < pr0xy> thanks everyone
22:57 < chapel> as long as the processing scripts are all the same
22:57 <@piscisaureus_> springmeyer: hey, yt?
22:57 < sinclair__> chapel: cluster works over the top of child_process
22:58 < springmeyer> piscisaureus_: yes
22:58 < chapel> sinclair__: but it adds a management layer on top that is very useful
22:58 < chapel> as far as communication and what not
22:58 < TooTallNate> tnorris: hmmm, well that's unfortunate
22:59  * sinclair__ is a bit concerned about using all these experimental features of node
22:59 < TooTallNate> tnorris: spec compliance is a bitch
22:59 < chapel> sinclair__: well some people would say node is experimental
22:59 < chapel> lol
23:00 < chapel> pr0xy: not sure what your exact use case is, but if you are trying to send an irc log for instance, you could use something like this https://github.com/jahewson/node-byline
23:00 < tnorris> TooTallNate: seriously. i'm looking at both implementations now to see if something can be done. could be fixed if Buffer was re-written in cpp, but don't like that idea.
23:00 < chapel> pr0xy: it will emit an event for every line which you could then send over websocket or do whatever you wanted with
23:00 < tnorris> oh. also, do you have any feedback on the diff on bug-4256?
23:01 < chapel> pr0xy: doing it like that would allow other code (http requests for instance) to run
23:02 < styol> Am I correct that Node.js recommends two spaces over a tab for indentation? If so, anybody know why JSLint throws "Expected 'x' at column y, not column z." on two spaces with the Node.js option set to true? Is it not indentation related?
23:03 < TooTallNate> tnorris: i don't think you should be doing the EventEmitt.call(process) at all
23:03 < TooTallNate> shouldn't be necessary
23:04 < tnorris> TooTallNate: and the generalized case: EventEmitt.call(<EventEmitt_instance>)
23:04 < chapel> styol: you should use jshint
23:04 < TooTallNate> tnorris: ya, why would you need to do that?
23:04 < chapel> styol: jshint can be just as strict as jslint, but it is much nicer and node friendly
23:05 < tnorris> TooTallNate: no idea. just figuring out why the bug is occurring.
23:05 < styol> chapel: awesome! Thanks
23:05 < chovy> can i use jshint from the cli
23:05 < TooTallNate> tnorris: well a segfault is definitely bad
23:05 < TooTallNate> we should probably look into that
23:06 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder v0.8 * 9b22944 : windows: fix the x64 debug build - http://git.io/Y0LWnA
23:06 < tnorris> TooTallNate: I've identified the line of code that causing it. really stupid actually.
23:06 < TooTallNate> tnorris: MakeCallback() or something?
23:06 < chapel> chovy: that is how you use it
23:06 < tnorris> it's like you said in your first post, an internal state is being over written.
23:07 < styol> chapel: hrm another similar one on jshint regarding function () {} <- missing semicolon
23:07 < chapel> chovy: I use a vim plugin that auto lints my code as I save and shows the results
23:07 < chapel> styol: jshint you need to change your settings
23:07 < chapel> if you want to ignore semi-colons for instance
23:09 < chovy> chapel: ok
23:09 < chovy> i'll look into it.
23:09 <@isaacs> coderarity: set cache:false in the st mount optins
23:10 <@isaacs> coderarity: i think that works
23:10 < tnorris> TooTallNate: but the offending code has been removed on master since 0.8.14, so it shouldn't be a problem next release.
23:10 <@isaacs> coderarity: oh, no.. you have to do it more explicitly
23:10 < styol> chapel: gotcha gotcha. I'm just trying to validate simple code per coding standards published by isaacs as I'm not able to find something on nodejs.org and figured something linty might have similar goals in mind with appropriate options
23:10 < TooTallNate> tnorris: interesting…
23:11 < tracker1> tnorris, leave it to someone who is/was a total newb with node to do such a thing.. :D
23:11 < TooTallNate> tnorris: have you tried compiling the v0.8 HEAD and confirming?
23:11 < tnorris> TooTallNate: I'll do that now. one sec.
23:11 < chapel> styol: yeah, Im sure there are some example configs people have, but don't know of any off the top of my head
23:11 <@isaacs> coderarity: um.. no, there's no way to turn it off entirely.  but yo ucan do mount=st({path,url, cache:{fd:{size:0},content:{size:0},stat:{size:0},index:{size:0},readdir:{size:0}} })
23:11 < styol> I may be remembering wrong, but was there another site or tool that helps one test the performance of certain code choices / approaches?
23:11 < MI6> joyent/node: Nathan Rajlich master * 5e4e87a : os: add os.endianness() function - http://git.io/B-BiYA
23:11 < coderarity> isaacs: alright
23:12 <@isaacs> coderarity: s/size/max/g
23:12 <@isaacs> coderarity: the args go to lru-cache
23:12 < styol> chapel: I was just trying the web version, so perhaps I should check out a different interface
23:13 < tnorris> tracker1: newbs are some of the best bug finders. ;)
23:13 < styol> ah, jsperf
23:14 < tracker1> tnorris, true enough... best bugs are race conditions in multithreaded code imho.. none of that here.
23:14 < MI6> joyent/node: piscisaureus created branch issue4256 - http://git.io/7o6N-A
23:15 < TooTallNate> tnorris: related: https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/92a26cb1bf3b
23:16 < tnorris> TooTallNate: strange. so the code has changed, but the segfault still occurs. hm...
23:16 < TooTallNate> tnorris: well try that patch ^
23:17 < tnorris> will do
23:20 < tnorris> TooTallNate: worked.
23:21 < tnorris> now just curious why the issue doesn't exist in 0.8.12 or prior.
23:21 < adrianF> hello, i have a EventEmitter2 specific question: is there any way to get the eventname, seperated by namespaces within the callback, when using wildcards? (this.events returns the full event name)
23:23 < tracker1> tnorris, because before it was explicitely "null" now it's "undefined" and passing through?
23:25 <@piscisaureus_> tnorris: the problem was that node would crash if a .domain property would be something other than an object or "undefined"
23:25 <@piscisaureus_> tnorris: but in that commit you find it was assinged null
23:25 <@piscisaureus_> *assigned
23:26 < tnorris> piscisaureus_: but then wouldn't all EventEmitter instantiations fail? why just the example in the bug?
23:31 < tnorris> isaacs: oh, and nm about the perf diff between array and arraybuffer. forgot to zero fill the buffer after instantiation.
23:32 < tnorris>  /\<array\>/buffer/
23:32 < other_guy> okay… so… I want to setup a predefined prototype for objects I'll create later.
23:33 < other_guy> like this...
23:34 < other_guy> https://github.com/Coradine/chinood/blob/master/index.js#L52
23:34 < other_guy> I have a function that can apply attributes to it based on some specification like this...
23:34 < other_guy> https://github.com/Coradine/chinood/blob/master/lib/base_model.js#L59
23:35 < other_guy> the problem is basically lines 60-70
23:35 < other_guy> by setting the .data member on the prototype, all my future objects share the same underlying .data reference
23:35 < other_guy> which is bad
23:35 < other_guy> if I remove lines 60-70
23:36 < other_guy> then everything works find with respect to the future getters and setters since they reference "this" and "this" is actually bound to an instance at that point
23:37 < other_guy> so what I want to be able to do is reference my future "this", but for the things that need to happen on lines 60-70
23:37 < tracker1> other_guy .. can't you just define them in your object constructor?  or assume defaults when/where they are needed?
23:38 < other_guy> tracker1, I could, but I was trying to avoid doing it in the constructor…. I was thinking what I might be able to get away with is assigning the model spec to the prototype, since that should be shared between all instances of the same type of model
23:38 < other_guy> and then on my getter I could check if there's a default for the attribute I'm looking up
23:38 < other_guy> and then return that if the attribute is currently undefined
23:39 < other_guy> basically lazily resolving what the default should be
23:39 < other_guy> because at that point I have a useful "this"
23:39 < tnorris> TooTallNate: so Buffer.fill uses `memset` and ArrayBuffer uses `calloc` to instantiate the memory block. can I assume that `calloc` is faster than `memset`?
23:40 < tracker1> other_guy, not quite sure what best to suggest.. but I tend to follow a leading underscore as a convention for something at a static level... so you could have say ._data for your defaults, and .data for your overrides?
23:40 < styol> TooTallNate++ very nice on process.hrtime()
23:40 < other_guy> I use _ as an indicator of a handle to some other scope, but I get what you're saying
23:41 < nlf> tnorris: yeah, calloc is faster
23:41 < other_guy> But yes, either way I think I'm going to have to do lazy getting
23:41 < TooTallNate> tnorris: idk on that one to be honest
23:41 < TooTallNate> styol: thanks :)
23:41 < other_guy> because in my static level defineAttribute function I have no way of referencing my future "this" value
23:41 < other_guy> that I can think of at least
23:41 < tnorris> nlf: thanks. do you know if there's a quick way to zero fill a memory block?
23:42 < nlf> hm.
23:42 < tracker1> other_guy, then again, I really try to avoid a lot of more classical OO constructs in JS...
23:42 < TooTallNate> tnorris: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3654905/faster-way-to-zero-memory-than-with-memset
23:43 < other_guy> lol, tracker1 that's how I got into this mess in the first place
23:43 < other_guy> this was all much easier when the model definitions just did all their setup in their own constructors
23:43 < other_guy> but it was slow
23:43 < other_guy> and blocked on CPU when I needed to setup a lot of them
23:44 < tnorris> TooTallNate: mother... i'm not near l33t enough to implement that.
23:44 < other_guy> all this trickery and wizardry is a result of the hoops I have to jump through to define the prototype once at app load
23:44 < other_guy> and then reuse that prototype
23:44 < other_guy> nlf, I'm giving a Riak & node.js talk here in Portland on the 19th, you should see if you can make it down, we get get drinks and nerd out a bit.  Depending on the day we might even be able to get out on the race track or place some golf or something.
23:45 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder issue4256 * 32df4e6 : domains: don't crash if domain is set to null - http://git.io/c4gaVA
23:45 < nlf> other_guy: i can look into it, not sure if i could or not offhand though
23:45 < TooTallNate> tnorris: well there's bzero() on some platforms right? i wonder if that's any faster
23:45 < other_guy> you should get your work to send you :-p
23:45 < tnorris> nlf: point is, if we can zero fill a Buffer as quickly as `calloc` then ArrayBuffer could inherit from Buffer. along with all the sweetness it brings.
23:46 < nlf> yeah i'm not sure if you can or not.. it sounds like memset is the fastest way according to the benchmark tootallnate just posted
23:46 < tracker1> other_guy, gotcha... not sure on that... usually not having to initialize too much at once...
23:47 < nlf> calloc should be the fastest way to get a memory block that's zeroed
23:47 < nlf> i doubt you'll be able to beat it
23:48 < tnorris> nlf: bugger. wish the ArrayBuffer spec didn't require it to be zero filled. would be so much faster.
23:49 < nlf> memset is about the best you can do
23:50 < tnorris> nlf: were you able to compile the bench TooTallNate posted? keeps giving me errors.
23:51 < nlf> didn't try
23:51 < MI6> joyent/node: Bert Belder v0.8 * b3bfb6f : domains: don't crash if domain is set to null  Closes #4256 - http://git.io/nHwbjA
23:53 < nlf> ah, yup there we go, got it to compile
23:55 < tnorris> nlf: um, I just ran `clang -O3 -o bench bench.cc`. did I miss something?
23:55 < chovy> jshint doesn't like express.static
23:55 < nlf> osx?
23:55 < tnorris> nlf: linux.
23:55 < nlf> ah
23:55 < nlf> not sure then
23:55 < nlf> i just built it on osx
23:55 < tnorris> hm, oh well. do your test results verify what that dude posted?
23:56 < nlf> if i -O3 i get 0.0000000 results for all three benchmarks haha
23:56 < tnorris> TooTallNate: since zero filling a Buffer is 50% slower, you think we could just extend ArrayBuffer with all of Buffer's awesomeness?
23:56 < nlf> with no optimizations, his zero_sizet function is fastest, but apparently that's due to cpu caching
23:57 <@isaacs> coderarity: npm install st@0.1.0
23:57 <@isaacs> coderarity: andthen mount=st({cache: false})
23:58 < coderarity> isaacs: wow, awesome!
23:59 < Raynos> isaacs: #winning
23:59 < Pavi> Hi
23:59 < Pavi> I have a doubt in node-gyp
23:59 < Pavi> How to get the node-gyp cross compiled
23:59 < tnorris> nlf: lol. how much of a diff does zero_sizet make? like, enough to consider implementing it?
