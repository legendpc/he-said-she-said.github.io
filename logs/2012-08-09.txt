00:00 <@Nexxy> Hotroot, maybe you could make it a edutainment tool
00:00 <@Nexxy> learn the concepts of programming/security with some game pseudo-code
00:00 < Hotroot> I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic, but it could teach people realistic security holes
00:01 < Hotroot> But it's supposed to be the 80's, so it wouldn't really be fitting
00:01 <@Nexxy> Hotroot, I'm always serious.
00:01 <@Nexxy> :|
00:01 <@Nexxy> ^ see?
00:01 < Hotroot> True that
00:01 < Hotroot> That face doesn't lie
00:01 <@Nexxy> I'm totally joking
00:02 <@Nexxy> but if you executed properly I think it'd be cool
00:02 < Hotroot> One thing I'd like to do is increase the potential once you have control of a system
00:03 < Hotroot> Make it harder to hack people, but more exciting when you do
00:03 < Stephen> Updating to 0.8.6, any gotchas folks want to bring up?
00:06 < Stephen> Anyone here willing to talk architecture for a few moments?
00:06 < mmalecki> Stephen: ChildProcess changes
00:06 < mmalecki> it emits close when output streams are closed
00:07 < mmalecki> instead of exit
00:07 < mmalecki> exit is emitted when process exits
00:07 < Hotroot> This is kind of cool too
00:07 < Hotroot> "This is the first release to include binary distributions for all supported Unix operating systems (Linux, Darwin, and SunOS)."
00:07 < Stephen> mmalecki: Thanks. I don't think that will affect me, not yet anyway
00:07 < Hotroot> Do they require root to execute?
00:08 < Stephen> I've got a PHP app which uses a restful API and has a rapid dev toolset backended by MySQL
00:08 < Stephen> If you're familiar with Recess! Framework, that's it.
00:09 < Stephen> My basic model is that a user hits the restful API with a JSON object, I need to process some rules over that object to decide if and what objects it becomes, update the db, and return back a JSON object
00:09 < Stephen> Pretty standard stuff
00:10 < Stephen> nodejs Restful API and DB layer are covered.
00:10 < Stephen> However, the rules in between...
00:10 < Stephen> Can anyone speak to how they like to manage that?
00:10 < Stephen> Ever-growing controllers just seems like a bad idea
00:11 < crabdude> Does anyone here know who (companies) have the largest socket.io/redis/node.js deployments and/or any data points on scaling (req/s, concurrency, etc….)?
00:12 < CIA-93> node: Ben Noordhuis master * r6b58800 / test/pummel/test-net-connect-econnrefused.js : test: fix pummel/test-net-connect-econnrefused - http://git.io/xNacEA
00:15 < ccowan> Stephen: I split my controllers up into individual files 
00:15 < ccowan> similar to how Rails does it
00:16 < Stephen> I've been looking into restmvc.js, seems like a quick way to emulate /some/ of my current functionality
00:16 < ccowan> so I have a web service endpoint like /api/v2/activity, /api/v2/activity/:id, etc then that will live in activities.js
00:16 < ccowan> I'm also using express for everything
00:16 < Stephen> ccowan: Following
00:17 < ccowan> I haven't looked at restmvc.js
00:17 < Stephen> Yeah, restmvc.js requires Mongoose & Express
00:17 < ccowan> but express is so damn easy I haven't needed to look at anything else
00:17 < ccowan> Our stack is Node.js/MySQL/Redis/Solr
00:17 < Stephen> restmvc just gives one a bunch of default controllers and routes out of the bag it seems
00:18 < Stephen> Solr?
00:18 < Stephen> Never heard of it
00:18 < ccowan> Apache Solr... it's a search engine
00:18 < Stephen> Ah, gotcha
00:18 < Stephen> Reading now
00:18 < Hotroot> Yeah, express is done quite well
00:18 < zak_> that's built on lucene yeah?
00:18 < Hotroot> Only quall with it was the docs to set it up
00:18 < ccowan> We also have a bunch of legacy stuff in PHP which we share sessions via Redis
00:18 < Stephen> So, I guess it's the rules part I'm really concerned about managing
00:19 < Stephen> My app is a game, so I'll give a real example:
00:19 < ccowan> I had to write a custom session handler to mimic how the connect sessions work
00:19 < ccowan> ^^^ in PHP
00:20 < Stephen> A user places a trap. Doing so sends a request to the server, which has to decide things like "Do they have this many, was there a spider to defend against it? Were their shields up? How many points do they lose for the hit?"
00:21 < Stephen> Some of these rules are dependent on one another
00:21 < Stephen> Others could happen async
00:21 <@Nexxy> spiders!
00:21 < Stephen> :-)
00:21 < Stephen> (My game is Nova Initia, shameless plug, sorry)
00:22 < Stephen> I've been converting it for close to a year, but every route I go down for this part just gets really friggen messy
00:22 < ccowan> Stephen: so you need to deal with the flow control
00:22 < ccowan> some stuff async some stuff serialized
00:23 < Hotroot> I like how your social network thing on the front page isn't obnoxious
00:23 < Stephen> Hotroot: Thanks
00:23 <@Nexxy> that's a lot of paperclips
00:23 < Stephen> ccowan: That sounds correct.
00:23  * Stephen pulls up the NodeJs modules wiki
00:23 < Stephen> Flow control eh
00:24 < ccowan> So I have a bunch of stuff like that as well due the legacy of our systems
00:24 < ccowan> I mostly use the "async" module for that
00:24 <@Nexxy> just to nitpick; control flow != flow control
00:24 < zak_> flow control? that sounds like something I saw on my 300 baud modem
00:25 <@Nexxy> zak_, lol yes
00:25 < ccowan> control flow
00:25 < ccowan> you get my point... you need to control the order in which stuff executes
00:25 < tprice> are js objects accessible from c+? if so is there a c JSON lib?
00:25 < ccowan> A > B > C & E,F,G (async)
00:26 < tprice> is there a faster way of doing JSON other then in js?
00:26 < zak_> tprice: i would imagine that there's a C JSON library
00:26 < zak_> JSON is just a notation
00:26 <@Nexxy> Stephen, http://www.nova-initia.com/remog/news
00:26 < zak_> tprice: i would say that reading/writing JSON in C is probably faster than JS in many scenarios
00:27 < ccowan> Stephen: lock that down :D
00:27 < Hotroot> I've heard that a lot of stuff in node runs faster as JS. Some was in C++ and they converted it for speed
00:28 < Stephen> Nexxy: Thanks, removed
00:28 <@Nexxy> Stephen, :)
00:28 < tprice> zak_> so you think doing json parsing in c to buffer would be faster the in js
00:28 < tprice> zak_> where is the data held when its in a buffer?
00:28 < zak_> tprice: depends. The real question is, why does that sort of speed matter?
00:29 < zak_> and why not simply try it?
00:29 < ccowan> Does anyone use promises to control the flow?
00:29 < zak_> whats that C/JS bridge-like thing called
00:29 < ccowan> I've only ever used async because it seemed the easiest to understand
00:29 < tprice> zak_> im not a c person im just thinking about how it works
00:29 < Stephen> ccowan: Development mode turned off, my bad
00:29 < tprice> thinking what might be faster
00:29 < ccowan> Stephen: :D
00:30 < zak_> tprice: i'm not too familiar with the C/JS bridge stuff. I imagine that you wold have to look at that framework first to determine if it were worth it
00:30 < ccowan> Stephen: it happens to the best of us... If you haven't made a mistake then you're not trying hard enough
00:30 < tprice> zak_> kk thanks
00:30 < Stephen> ccowan: Promises are beautiful in this situation. I'd love to use a deferred factory and a single when() clause to wait for them to finish and return the request
00:31 < Stephen> As long as I write it so that all promises always get resolved every time.
00:32 < ccowan> "async" seems less magical
00:32 < ccowan> if that makes sense :D
00:32 < Spion_> and if you're willing to be blasphemous try streamlinejs
00:33 < zak_> tprice: I found what I was trying to mention previous. Ajax.org O3
00:33 < zak_> http://www.slideshare.net/javruben/server-side-javascript-ajaxorg-o3-2466259
00:33 < zak_> you might want to look at that and see if it helps you understand your problem in someway
00:33 < Stephen> ccowan: Makes perfect sense
00:34 < zak_> my advice would be to look at your bigger problem first. Preoptimisation is the root of all evil
00:34 < Stephen> Hmm, this also seems very interesting
00:34 < Stephen> https://github.com/Pita/channels
00:34 < tprice> when i convert a sting to buffer where does the data/memory sit. if i write that buffer to tcp stream does the data go through js land or is it optimized in some how in the backend of node?
00:34 < tprice> is a buffer just a memory map?
00:34 < tprice> kinda thing...
00:34 < zak_> yeah, that really goes beyond my knowledge of how nodejs manages those things
00:34 < zak_> i would just try it
00:34 < zak_> build some performance tests around it. Good framework to see if you can improve it someway
00:35 < bnoordhuis> tprice: it's a chunk of memory that's malloced on the heap
00:35 < bnoordhuis> that's the c heap, not the v8 heap
00:35 < tprice> bnoordhuis> thanks. thats what i thought
00:35 < tprice> so any chance i have i should write the string to buffer?
00:36 < bnoordhuis> tprice: depends. what are you doing?
00:36 < Stephen_> Sorry about that, did anyone comment about channels?
00:38 < Stephen> eh, dinner is served, I'll bbiab. Msg me if anyone would like to talk further. Hell, I'd like to get a dev or two more on this project if anyone's interested.
00:38 < tprice> bnoordhuis> say i convert an object to string then wait to write it out to say tcp server. would it be better to write the json string to buffer while i wait to write it out to a socket?
00:38 < tprice> or keep it as a sting in js
00:39 < ccowan> channels looks interesting
00:40 < bnoordhuis> tprice: convert as in JSON.stringify? if yes, no - node optimizes string writes better than you can in js
00:41 < tprice> bnoordhuis> so should keep the sting as a string and not a buffer
00:41 < tprice> what if i had an array of sting that would not be better then an array of buffers>
00:45 < bnoordhuis> tprice: keep it as strings
00:45 < bnoordhuis> look at src/stream_wrap.cc if you want to know why that's a good idea :)
00:46 < bnoordhuis> but essentially you'd be doing the work that node already does for you automatically, only slower
00:48 < tprice> kk thanks
00:50 < zak_> I'm trying to use Sinon with AMD
00:51 < zak_> How should I be loading it? Do I need to modify sinon.js to return something?
01:01 < TehShrike> I'm in for 50$ - but for it to actually matter to me, the Node.js community is going to have to join up, too: https://join.app.net/
01:02 < TehShrike> I'm ready for a new Twitter... I'm hoping SubStack and isaacs and the gang come along too
01:03 < garthk> Aha! Generic resource pool: https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool
01:03 < garthk> Anyone used it?
01:36 < papaivan> hello everybody
01:39 < stagas> hi
01:42 < zivester> is it preferred to keep package requirements 'node_modules' for a package within the package, or just put a note in the README that certain files are required?
01:42 <@Nexxy> zivester, don't put a package within a package
01:43 < zivester> i.e. if I'm creating an image library that depends on node-imagemagick.... so don't include it in my package
01:44 < zivester> Nexxy: so if i get my package in npm... does npm install mypackage install the required modules, or do I need to reference the required ones somewhere in the install guide?
01:44 < zivester> I guess, would it handle dependencies
01:44 < stagas> zivester: use package.json
01:46 < zivester> thank you stagas and Nexxy
01:47 < stagas> zivester: "npm init" in project root will generate one for you then "npm install dep --save" to add the dependency in
01:51 < red5> Is it possible to import one anonymous function on node.js with require ?
01:52 < stagas> red5: sure, module.exports = function () { ... }
01:53 < red5> stagas: is there another way ?
01:53 < stagas> red5: why do you need another way?
01:53 < stagas> no
01:53 < red5> stagas: i have one "var My = (function() { ... })(); " 
01:54 < red5> stagas: is it possible to use this pattern to import with require ?
01:54 < papaivan> one question, node version 3.0.0rc1 , the method dynamicHelper 
01:55 <@Nexxy> red5, just `module.exports = My;`
01:55 < papaivan> how to use this method now? I could not find reference about this change
01:56 < red5> Nexxy: but this code i'll use on html. is there any problem ?
01:56 < Domenic__> papaivan: node has not even made it to 1.0, much less 3.0
01:56 < papaivan> sorry 
01:56 <@Nexxy> red5, on html? you mean client-side?
01:56 < andy88> Is node able to "watch" a table in my mysql database so that when a new item is added to the table, it automatically displays it on my website to all users? I have been trying to do this for hours and I have only been able to hack something together that isn't satisfactory.
01:56 < papaivan> my mistake 
01:56 < stagas> red5: or var My = require('./foo')()
01:56 < red5> Nexxy: yes, client-side. 
01:56 <@Nexxy> red5, there are various ways to get require working on the client. I recommend browserify :)
01:57 < stagas> red5: or this https://github.com/stagas/frequire
01:57 <@Nexxy> andy88, is the db being written to by an application you don't have control over?
01:58 < stagas> which also supports components
01:58 < andy88> Nexxy, I have control over everything
01:58 <@Nexxy> andy88, then why not trigger the update when an item is added?
01:58 <@Nexxy> you don't need to "watch" the table if you have control over the "add" function
01:59 <@Nexxy> you don't even need to read the data from the db as long as you know the INSERT executed properly
01:59 < andy88> Nexxy, that is what I am doing, but I dont think it is going to all users. It's only going to the user who added the item to the database
01:59 <@Nexxy> andy88, use socket.io or socksjs or something?
01:59 < andy88> Nexxy, I actually am using socket.io
01:59 <@Nexxy> you should be able to just use .broadcast
02:00 < andy88> Nexxy, oh yea forget about that haha
02:00 <@Nexxy> ^-^
02:00 < andy88> ill try it out
02:00 <@Nexxy> good luck!
02:00 < red5> Nexxy: ok. thx
02:00 < andy88> thanks
02:01 <@Nexxy> red5, but of course!
02:01 <@Nexxy> cc/ tmpvar 
02:02 < red5> stagas: i created one module where i defined an object using singleton pattern. So how import this on jasmine specs? is it possible ?
02:06 < tmpvar> Nexxy, hrm?
02:06 < stagas> red5: no idea
02:11 < SubStack> garthk: perhaps you could use a regular http server instead of bouncy for the mux-demuxery?
02:12 < SubStack> you could always have bouncy pass a stream to a regular http server that streams to mux-demux too
02:13 < garthk> SubStack: worth a shot.
02:14 < SubStack> garthk: it might be useful to decouple the http stream from the body stream in bouncy with a separate api endpoint though
02:18 < StayInSkool> hey guys. how do you profile the memory of your node.js app? i've tried node-inspector and v8-profiler but the Profiles tab never shows up, even when i trigger a snapshot from within my app
02:19 < StayInSkool> nodetime just makes my app hang :/
02:20 <@Nexxy> tmpvar, nothing lol ._.
02:20 < _ritch> StayInSkool: not a direct answer, but might be useful: http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_memoryusage - its helped me do some profiling
02:20 < tmpvar> rawr!
02:20 <@Nexxy> !
02:24 < StayInSkool> _ritch: thanks. im looking to check which one of my methods is leaking
02:24 < StayInSkool> as i can't tell which. I just see node's footprint grow and grow
02:25 < Domenic__> StayInSkool: in theory it could not be a leak, just the GC holding on to memory and deciding it might need it later. That's happened to us.
02:26 < StayInSkool> i'd like to know :D
02:26 < Domenic__> StayInSkool: we had no luck with node-inspector, v8-profiler, or node-webkit-agent (same problem, no profiles tab), but nodetime did work for us :-/
02:26 < StayInSkool> hrm. i'll try it again
02:26 < StayInSkool> thanks Domenic__ 
02:26 < StayInSkool> i've managed to get the profiles tab going on node-inspector by downgrading it to an earlier version but, v8-profiler errors out
02:27 <@Nexxy> just implemented util.format myself and then remembered it exists.
02:31 < zak_> what colour is your wheel?
03:01 < stalemate> hi
03:02 < cainus> any forever users?  I'm looking for a watchDirectory example... it seems to hate me
03:07 < Stephen> anyone still up?
03:14 <@Nexxy> Stephen, always
03:15 < Stephen> :-)
03:15 < tchopper> I'll be up for a bit more. I'm automating my Node/Express setup with a few manual tweaks.
03:16 <@Nexxy> \o/
03:16 < Stephen> Seeing that restmvc.js uses Express & Mongoose, I think I'm going to give it a shot first. This "channels" script, though simple, seems like an interesting way of dealing with ordered event handlers.
03:16 < Stephen> I mean, the script is nothing more than this:
03:16 < Stephen> https://github.com/Pita/channels/blob/master/channels.js
03:17 < Stephen> If I'm reading it correctly, channels of different names process async of one another
03:17 < Stephen> queues of the same channel process in order
03:19 <@Nexxy> L_star, are you in a technology loop?
03:19 <@Nexxy> Ls_Away, *
03:23 < Stephen> Nexxy: Hah, Async.js wins, check this out:
03:23 < Stephen> https://github.com/caolan/async/#auto
03:24 <@Nexxy> Stephen, interesting!
03:25 <@Nexxy> I wasn't aware of auto
03:25 < Stephen> It seems like a great way of structuring method dependancy
03:29 < ccowan> async is the shit... 
03:30 < ccowan> I've used just about every one of the different queues and methods
03:30 < ccowan> it's the second most handy library in my quiver
03:30 < Init--WithStyle-> Has anyone used "world machine" before? It's used to generate heightmaps for web apps/games
03:31 < Stephen> Hmm... it appears cloud9 has significantly changed.
03:31 < Stephen> If I didn't know any better I'd say they didn't like people running it on their own boxes
03:35 < Stephen> I saw the release notes talking about changing from buffers to Typed Arrays, any ideas when we might see that?
03:41 < ctult> What does DocumentCloud do to give that awesome Underscore.js documentation?
03:43 < nakkor> ctult: Docco husky will do the same thing
03:43 < gkatsev> it's compiled via something
03:43 < nakkor> https://github.com/mbrevoort/docco-husky
03:43 < gkatsev> docco, that's exactly it
03:43 < gkatsev> I guess docco husky is a fork
03:44 < ctult> I love that documentation theme.
03:45 < timeturner> is it better to start on the server-side or client-side for a single page app?
03:45 < timeturner> start coding*
03:45 < ctult> Would docco be as good as pdoc?
03:45 < gkatsev> timeturner: single page apps have a server-side component? :P
03:47 < timeturner> lol
03:47 < timeturner> I meant if the single page app thing makes a difference to the "order of coding" so to speak
03:48 < timeturner> right now I'm kind of doing the server then a bit of the client and repeat
03:48 < timeturner> in chunks basically
03:50 < Stephen> Anyone familiar with installing multiple versions of nodejs on the same box?
03:50 < timeturner> https://github.com/visionmedia/n/
03:51 < Stephen> I need to install 0.6.19 for cloud9, but I'd rather keep my main version as 0.8.6
03:51 < chilts> Stephen: use n, nave or nvm
03:51 < chilts> I use nvm and I like it
03:51  * SubStack has been using nave
03:51 < timeturner> I like n because it's one letter
03:51 < SubStack> they're all pretty similar, just pick one and roll with it
03:51 < timeturner> yeah they all do the same thing pretty much
03:52 < DTrejo> is nave still having wierd stuff happening when you npm -g install?
03:52 < DTrejo> I keep getting cert errors
03:52 < gkatsev> timeturner: idk, i dont think there's really any difference. as long as you have an idea and everything planned.
03:52 < rvagg> do any of them support CAPSLOCKSCRIPT though?
03:52 < gkatsev> timeturner: couchdb can actually host files for you as well so you can make couchapps.
03:52 < rvagg> that's a must!
03:54 < timeturner> gkatsev: hmm, might look into it then. thx
03:54 < gkatsev> np
03:54 < gkatsev> it's cool
03:54 < Stephen> SubStack: If I use nave, do I need to reinstall node using it before things run properly, or just the new versions I need?
03:55 < SubStack> Stephen: you can use the old version of node you've already installed but to get new versions you just do `nave install 0.8.4` or whatevs
03:55 < Stephen> k
03:55 < SubStack> then `nave use 0.8.4` when it's done compiling
03:55 < SubStack> unsure about the other tools but it's probably something similar
03:55 < Stephen> hmm...
03:55 < Stephen> creates a shell, eh?
03:56 < Stephen> gonna have to see how well that works with bash scripts
03:57 < DTrejo> +1 nave :)
03:57 < DTrejo> or any thing that auto-installs node versions
03:57 < cainus> hey all... any forever users?  I'm looking for a watchDirectory example... it seems to hate me
04:00 < rvagg> can someone put a bullet in Ls_Away?
04:00 <@Nexxy> zomg 0.8.5 is actually compilign on beagleboard xM
04:00 <@Nexxy> rvagg, lol
04:03 < DTrejo> npmbro search git
04:03 <@Nexxy> I had to add variables to common.gypi thought ;<
04:03 <@Nexxy> though*
04:03 < DTrejo> npmbro search git
04:03 < npmbro> DTrejo: Please see http://eirikb.github.com/nipster/#git
04:03 <@Nexxy> npmbro die
04:03 < npmbro> Nexxy: Please see npm's documentation at https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fnpmjs.org%2Fdoc%2F%20die
04:03 < DTrejo> he is less verbose now!
04:03 <@Nexxy> \o/
04:03 < DTrejo> npm does not activate him
04:03 < DTrejo> and he supposedly has a throttle
04:03 < DTrejo> but I suspect it does not work
04:04 <@Nexxy> uh oh ;o
04:04 <@Nexxy> npmbro search  
04:04 < npmbro> Nexxy: Please see http://eirikb.github.com/nipster/#
04:04 <@Nexxy> npmbro search pancake
04:04 < npmbro> Nexxy: Please see http://eirikb.github.com/nipster/#pancake
04:05 < DTrejo> I may just stop it again until I fix the throttle
04:05 <@Nexxy> oh
04:11 < airandfingers> hi
04:11 < Stephen> heya airandfingers
04:12 < Stephen> interesting... nave installs the node versions per user, not global
04:12 < DTrejo> my work is done for today https://github.com/sentientwaffle/gift/issues/10
04:12 < Stephen> DTrejo: I've yet to see your waffle talk, therefore I scoff at your premise
04:12 < Stephen> None the less I will read
04:12 < DTrejo> haha

04:13 < Stephen> lol
04:13 < airandfingers> darnit, i'm looking for the express 2.x guide, but it's not on http://expressjs.com/guide.html anymore (and #express has nothing to say)
04:13 < Stephen> Dude, seriously, you should win an emmy

04:52 < nonuby> is it possible to which a static node executable (not talking about bundling code) just having a static /usr/bin/node with no dynamic dependencies (e.g. libssl) etc.
04:53 < timeturner> isn't that what compiling does?
04:54 < timeturner> if you're not talking about bundling code
04:54 < nonuby> no. the dependencies are resolved at with runtime linker, e.g. shared object libssl.so 
04:55 < nonuby> a static executable has all dependencies rolled in and only depends on a certain arch and to an extent a min kernel version depending on which version of libc is used
04:57 < timeturner> https://github.com/robhawkes/node-extension/issues/1
04:57 < timeturner> you can pass in the option to ./configure
04:59 < rvagg> gah! shoot him!
05:00 < rvagg> Nexxy: +o comes with certain responsibilities....
05:00 < TehShrike> isaacs: you around?
05:02 < context> nonuby: usually when doing ./configure you can do --static or something similar
05:06 < nonuby> context, thanks will check
05:11 <@Nexxy> rvagg, such as?
05:34 < rvagg> Nexxy: /kick l_star
05:34 <@Nexxy> rvagg, he's not doing anythign wrong
05:34 < rvagg> away spamming
05:34 <@Nexxy> rvagg, just put him on ignore if it bothers you that much
05:34 <@Nexxy> I don't think it's on purpose :P
05:34 <@Nexxy> I will leave him a message about it
05:34 < rvagg> can't work out how to ignore in pidgin.... /ignore don't work
05:34 <@Nexxy> perhaps you should consider a real IRC client :P
05:35 < rvagg> I'd rather just rant and make a noisy fuss, makes me feel better
05:35 <@Nexxy> that works :P
05:43 < Tatsh> trying to use socket.io and whenever i connect the ws://localhost URI, i get ECONNREFUSED
05:44 < Tatsh> i mean, the ws:// connection works and the server sends back some data; but then another request and it says ECONNREFUSED
06:03 < tasslehoff> Hi. I'm creating a couple of simple websites on my embedded system (file upload and file browse/download). I've never used node, js or node.js before. Is there a recommended starting point, or would you just get some examples from The Internet and learn by doing?
06:03 < tasslehoff> Google showed me many examples I think could be tweaked to fit my needs.
06:13 <@Nexxy> 41 failed tests on beagleboard xM
06:35 < tasslehoff> I should be able to run the example from https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static directly, and then open a browser on http://<my-ip>:8080, shouldn't I? I get "link appears to be broken" from Chrome.
06:37 <@Nexxy> thanpolas, http://127.0.0.1:8080/
06:37 <@Nexxy> err, tasslehoff ^
06:38 < tasslehoff> Nexxy: ah, of course. I run the server on my embedded system and want to reach it from my host, so I need to change something. thanks.
06:49 < tasslehoff> Nexxy: shouldn't I be able to reach it from the outside since I've omitted the hostname?
06:52 < ryanrolds> tasslehoff: Should be able to, is it behind a firewall or nat?
06:54 < egukin> Hi everyone. I’m looking to write a simple JSON-based web service powered by Node.js
06:54 < egukin> what would be the most straightforward way to approach this? Meaning, minimum third-party modules, yet maximum flexibility and ease of writing?
06:55 < egukin> e.g. I don’t really want to use Express here, I think it’s an overkill
06:55 < egukin> or should I?
06:56 < freewil> i dont see how you could think express is "overkill"
06:56 < ryanrolds> egukin: Do you every plan on using sessions? Also Express is only as much overkill as you make it.
06:56 < freewil> but you could just use connect if you want it even more simple
06:56 < ryanrolds> You only load the modules you need.
06:56 < zhodge> what's up with #javascript being invite-only now?
06:56 < egukin> ryanrolds: no, no sessions
06:57 < ryanrolds> Express with just the router and bodyParser will make your life a lot easier without much overhead.
06:58 < egukin> ryanrolds: I see, alright. Thanks. Is it worth to combine/replace it with something like Journey? https://github.com/cloudhead/journey
06:58 < freewil> yup - and then just a custom middleware if you need authentication
06:59 < ryanrolds> egukin: cloudhead and indexzero are both awesome devs, but the project has't been touched in 7 months.
06:59 < tasslehoff> ryanrolds: no. another example listening the same way works, so it must be something about how I use the node-static module.
07:00 < ryanrolds> tasslehoff: Can you provide a gist with the important pieces?
07:01 < ryanrolds> egukin: Oh and mmalecki is awesome too. Didn't want to leave him out.
07:03 < egukin> ryanrolds: okay, got it. So I believe I should be fine with just Express without extra framework modules
07:03 < tasslehoff> ryanrolds: https://gist.github.com/3301818, the node-static.js doesn't work for me, no-node-static.js does
07:07 < ryanrolds> tasslehoff: What version of Node.js?
07:07 < appinsanity_> who was fucking with marak today? and why?
07:08 < jondot_> hello, does anyone know if there's a client for redis that accepts a redis DB name?
07:09 < jondot_> that is a number 0-15
07:09 < owen1> i noticed that response.write('hello\n'); is sent to the client. but ommiting the \n does not. is it chrome specific or is that node's way to stream part of the response to clients?
07:10 < owen1> (hello is sent)
07:11 < appinsanity_> who was fucking with marak today? and why?
07:12 < indexzero> egukin ryanrolds: Thanks. We dropped journey in favor of a new library: director (http://github.com/flatiron/director)
07:13 < ryanrolds> indexzero: Thanks, good to know.
07:13 < appinsanity_> who was fucking with marak today? and why? he is a valuable node hacker no?
07:13 < ryanrolds> appinsanity_: ?
07:14 < appinsanity_> marak from jit.su
07:14 < ryanrolds> jondot_: I think you can do that with node-redis, but you have to use the select command after you connect.
07:15 < indexzero> appinsanity_: dramascript; it happens
07:15 < rvagg> nerds are just as good at drama as everyone else, we're not so special
07:16 < appinsanity_> indexzero: nope
07:17 < jondot_> ryanrolds: yes, thanks
07:17 < appinsanity_> node is awesome and that was pure bullshit
07:25 < tasslehoff> ryanrolds: 0.6.18, it seems (node --version)
07:25 < ryanrolds> tasslehoff: Hum, I'm at a loss. Any errors? You may want to create an issue on github.
07:30 < tasslehoff> ryanrolds: no errors. I'll dig a bit more and see if I can figure it out. thanks for taking a look.
07:31 < ryanrolds> tasslehoff: If the code in an example isn't working, that's very good reason to create an issue ticket.
07:34 < tasslehoff> ryanrolds: yes. I'm just gonna try to properly install node-static to see if that helps, and also try it locally on my host.
07:35 < DTrejo> How rotten is your startup's git repo? `npm -g install rotten; rotten` Tweet your score with hashtag #rotten ;) https://github.com/DTrejo/rotten
07:36 < DTrejo> RT me :) https://twitter.com/ddtrejo/status/233466456917028864
07:36 < rvagg> I'm interested to know *why* you created that DTrejo, do you have a particularly rotten repo?
07:37 < DTrejo> mostly trying to find branches that were already in prod that needed deleting :)
07:37 < DTrejo> `rotten` makes that easy
07:43 < Hotroot> I am a confused panda. I have the user enter password, and then the password again when making an account, pretty standard stuff
07:43 < Hotroot> Then I use if (pass !== passver) {
07:43 < Hotroot> To warn them that it didn't match
07:43 < Hotroot> When I type the same password twice, that if goes off
07:43 < Hotroot> I console.logged it
07:43 < tasslehoff> ryanrolds: as expected it was entirely my fault. I had misunderstood how this was meant to work. <ip>:8080/<file-in-the-dir-I-share> worked fine.
07:44 < Hotroot> Pass = lolman and passver = lolman
07:44 < ljharb> Hotroot: whoa whoa whoa. NEVER EVER EVER store passwords like that.
07:44 <@Nexxy> Hotroot, Pass != pass
07:44 <@Nexxy> and ignore ljharb 
07:44 < ljharb> or are you just talking about a password confirmation on signup
07:44 < Hotroot> Dude, I'm not storing passwords like that
07:44 < ljharb> lol ok
07:44 < ljharb> then yes, ignore me
07:44 <@Nexxy> :)
07:44 < Hotroot> They get sha512'd
07:45 <@Nexxy> Hotroot, whoa whoa whoa. NEVER EVER EVER store passwords like that.
07:45 <@Nexxy> everyone knows ripemd160 + whirlpool or GTFO
07:45 < Hotroot> ?
07:45 < Hotroot> Lol
07:45 < Hotroot> Anyway, what was that about pass != pass?
07:45 < jondot_> IoC for nodejs that should be useful for testing - yes or no?
07:45 < Hotroot> If you mean case sensitive, I didn't fuck that up
07:45 < stagas> Hotroot: one hash is just as good as plain text
07:46 < Hotroot> It's telnet...
07:46 <@Nexxy> Hotroot, yeah
07:46 < Hotroot> I think security is a small deal here
07:46 < rvagg> Hotroot: try !=, perhaps you're not dealing with objects of exactly the same time (a typeof would be interesting)
07:46 < Hotroot> The user's string gets .split
07:46 < Hotroot> Oh shit
07:46 <@Nexxy> the truth comes out
07:46 < rvagg> heh
07:46 < Hotroot> There's a " " at the end
07:46 < Hotroot> Possibly
07:47 <@Nexxy> now what happens if they actually put spaces in their passwords?
07:47 < rvagg> this would be a much better authentication mechanism: if (/^.*$/.test(pass)) { good to go }
07:48 < Hotroot> No, no spaces added, I just checked. 
07:48 < Hotroot> I don't allow spaces in the password
07:48 < Hotroot> Way more work than it's worth in telnet
07:49 < Hotroot> So, I have no idea. They are both strings. Does "string" != "string" ?
07:49 < rvagg> if they are both strings then you should be fine with != and !==
07:49 < Hotroot> Unless false counts somehow? 
07:49 < Hotroot> data.replace(/\r|\n/g,"");
07:49 < Hotroot> Assuming the "" doesn't "add" anything in
07:50 < rvagg> no
07:50 < Hotroot> I'm doing !== and it doesn't work
07:50 < Hotroot> I'll try !=, but I don't want that to be a final solution
07:50 < rvagg> do a console.log of each of your strings with a .split("") to see exactly what characters you have in there, perhaps there's some strays.. even a .length might be interesting
07:51 < Hotroot> Yeah, thought about .length
07:51 < Hotroot> They get .split(" ") already
07:51 < Hotroot> Doesn't work with != 0.o
07:51 < rvagg> ya, but a .split("") will arrayify the individual characters, might be interesting to see what that looks like on console.log
07:51 < Hotroot> Again, console.logged "Pass = lolman and passver = lolman"
07:52 < rvagg> so you're doing a .split(" ") and picking off a piece of the returned array? you're not comparing the full result of the .split(" ") are you?
07:52 < ljharb> wait, why are you splitting a password on spaces?
07:52 < ljharb> "correct horse battery staple" is a perfectly fine password
07:52 < Hotroot> I'm splitting the entire string on spaces
07:52 < Hotroot> It's telnet
07:53 < Hotroot> TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
07:53 < Hotroot> The fuck
07:54 < rvagg> heh
07:54 < Hotroot> Sounds like some Chinese proverb thing. "What is a string, but not a string?"
07:54 < rvagg> perhaps you need to paste a gist so we can see some context
07:55 < Hotroot> The bigger kids will laugh at me
07:55 < Hotroot> Seriously though, yeah, I will if I can't get this
07:56 < [AD]Turbo> hola
07:57 < rvagg> we've all been 'little kids' before Hotroot, it's ok
07:58 < nonuby> is there a way to launch a child_process with a different uid/gid without an intermediate sudo process?
07:58 < Hotroot> sudo process or pseudo process?
07:59 < nonuby> node running as root launching a process as weakuser
08:00 < Hotroot> Interesting
08:00 < Hotroot> It thinks the password verification is 235 characters long 0.o
08:01 < Hotroot> I dun goofed somehwere
08:01 < rvagg> Hotroot: and you're sure you're not dealing with a Buffer rather than a string? a common mistake with network programming
08:02 < Hotroot> socket.setEncoding('ascii');
08:02 < Hotroot> I do use a buffer to store it though, which is very likely the source of the problem here
08:02 < rvagg> nonuby: there are 'uid' and 'gid' options you can pass in to the various child_process methods
08:03 < Hotroot> yup, theBuffer.toString("utf8");
08:03 < owen1> i noticed that response.write('hello\n'); will send 'hello' to the client. but ommiting the \n does not. is it chrome specific or is that node's way to stream part of the response to it's clients?
08:04 < nonuby> rvagg, perhaps they have been removed ? http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options
08:04 < Hotroot> Apparently toString doesn't know to cut out the blank space
08:04 < rvagg> nonuby: they are there, use the force luke
08:04 < nonuby> rvagg, thanks will check source on how forever does it
08:05 < rvagg> https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.8.6-release/src/process_wrap.cc#L156
08:05 < nonuby> rvagg, awesome thanks
08:05 < rvagg> in that code, js_options comes from your code, options is passed to the OS
08:06 < nonuby> got it, thanks very much
08:11 < Hotroot> I'm still not sure why this things length is 235
08:12 < Hotroot> I socket.write()'ed it back, and it looked normal
08:12 < Hotroot> Probably a good time to update node
08:14 < Hotroot> Err, how do I remove npm and node?
08:14 < Hotroot> Or is there now a way to update without re-installing?
08:16 < Hotroot> Nevermind, sudo make uninstall worked great
08:17 < Hotroot> Thanks all
08:18 < innociv_> http://pastebin.com/X8EVpZwS Can anyone tell me why this monit config doesn't work?  The program isn't being stopped, when I see the pidid matching what's in the pidfile of the program that's using too much cpu.  It's a node script that's started with forever --pidFile
08:30 < owen1> when a client connect to a node server, will the http connection will remain forever?
08:30 < owen1> (or the client dies?
08:30 < mscdex> probably not forever
08:30 < owen1> if that's the case, what is the reason? so the server will stream data whenever he want to?
08:32 < mscdex> owen1: if you want to do streaming stuff in the browser, you might take a look at socket.io
08:33 < owen1> ok. but my question is why does node use keep-alive? is it so the client will be able to make additional requests without the http hand-shake or is it so the server will be able to send data multiple times(streams?) in a single request?
08:34 < lz> owen1, I'm guessing it's the latter
08:34 < mscdex> keep-alive is there so that the connection can be re-used instead of tearing down the tcp connection after every response
08:36 < owen1> got it. so maybe the Transfer-Encoding: chunked  is the thing that allow streaming some data by the server?
08:36 < owen1> mscdex: lz ^
08:37 < mscdex> yes, chunked encoding allows for a response where the total length of the response is not known ahead of time
08:37 < lz> ah
08:38 < lz> thanks for clarifying!
08:39 < owen1> mscdex: so if it's part of http, why is it so hard to stream in ruby? i guess it's a question for $ruby-lang
08:39 < mscdex> i can't really answer that as i've hardly used ruby much
08:41 <@Nexxy> owen1, I don't think people were really paying attention to streaming in 1995
08:42 < mscdex> chunked encoding wasn't a part of HTTP until HTTP 1.1
08:43 < mscdex> which came out in 1999 i think
08:43 <@Nexxy> 96ish?
08:43 <@Nexxy> depends on what you mean by "came out"
08:43 <@Nexxy> "drafted", "standardized", or "actually adopted"
08:44 < mscdex> standardized ;-)
08:46 < owen1> i read this: "Rails is clearly not evented"
08:46 < owen1> what does it mean? rails not using callbacks? rails does not have event loop?
08:47 < SubStack> in rails each request gets its own thread
08:47 < SubStack> so you've got to use special abstractions to share state among requests
08:47 < SubStack> commonly people use the database which is a bit silly for ephemeral data sometimes
08:48 < SubStack> if you want to have long-running shared connections or references among requests you need to go through hacky queue interfaces
08:49 < owen1> SubStack: can't u use a class variables? u can access them from any request, right?
08:49 < owen1> (in ruby)
08:50 < technocrat> But its not mutable i think...
08:51 < owen1> i am going to talk about node tomorrow in LA ruby meetup and want to understand the difference between ruby and node when it comes to streaming and i/o approach.
08:56 < owen1> going to sleep, but if you guys have any insights i'll read/reply tomorrow morning (my irc is still connected)
09:00 < SubStack> owen1: you can't use class variables without doing some extra work because the state needs to be synched back up
09:01 < SubStack> so mutexes, queues, or per-session connections to long-running external resources are the usual avenues of attack
09:02 < SubStack> owen1: if you just show them var state = {} and then you mess with that state in the request handlers I think people will see the benefit of that right away
09:03 < SubStack> it means you can spend less time hacking the concurrency system and more time figuring out how to make your program work

09:36 < technocrat> @ancien just request it via http like regular ajax, but server to server
09:36 < technocrat> use the http module for that
09:36 < justanewbie> !tell technocrat help
09:37 < Ancien> but tcp isn't more adapt for do that ?
09:38 < Ancien> i have read an post who says tcp is more fast than http
09:38 < technocrat> if you have tcp server in pho than you can play with it, you can even go with udo, but... why?
09:38 < justanewbie> stagas and sriley and Benvie also technocrat,please help
09:38 < technocrat> it doesnt have headers, but you probably want them, but for streaming it may be a better approach
09:40 < Ancien> ok so i will try with http
09:43 < Ancien> how can i get http module ?
09:43 < technocrat> justanewbie: can check your code as im on an ipad, but pasting the error can be helpful

10:28 < Industrial> What are good options for deploying NodeJS servers? Are there total packages? (git, process monitoring, etc)

11:21 < rvagg> Industrial: nodejitsu if you want the full package
11:22 < rvagg> Industrial: otherwise, if you want more DIY then you could browse through some of SubStack repos, starting with fleet: https://github.com/substack/fleet/ and perhaps seaport, depending on what you want to do

11:59 < devaholic> that makes no sense
12:00 < innociv_> "... using too much cpu"
12:01 < devaholic> rsmol: if you can find a way to run bash in fish (ive no idea) nvm is pretty much a standard
12:02 < devaholic> innociv_: is forever restarting the program or something? not really enough info to help you there

12:34 < ProblemEmitter> guys, is it possible to build a statically linked binary of 0.8.6 ?
12:35 < ProblemEmitter> i've tried the official 0.8.6 binary distribution for Linux, but it fails to start because of some libc shit
12:39 < totallymike> ProblemEmitter: Why do you need a statically linked binary?
12:39 < totallymike> I'm not doubting your need, just curious.
12:39 < rvagg> ProblemEmitter: just build from source and you should be fine
12:39 < ProblemEmitter> Well, because im on such a server, that updating node.js means calling some people and waiting a week
12:39 < ProblemEmitter> And im running the LEAKY 0.8.2 version
12:39 < totallymike> ouch.  you can't compile it yourself?
12:40 < ProblemEmitter> there is no compiler :( very strict security on that server
12:40 < totallymike> Too bad.
12:40 < totallymike> So you want to cross-compile and sling the binary over.
12:40 < ProblemEmitter> yes, something like that
12:41 < ProblemEmitter> is it possible to build just one big executable file that contains everything needed?
12:42 < totallymike> I should expect so, as it seems that's what joyent is doing.
12:42 < totallymike> Hit up the gcc docs for static flags.
12:42 < innociv_> devaholic, yes forever will start it after it's killed

12:43 < devaholic> innociv_: so is monit watching forever?
12:44 < innociv_> Well it should be watching the pid, right?
12:44 < innociv_> I have it checking the pidfile
12:44 < innociv_> I don't know. I can't tell what's going on.
12:52 < innociv_> Maybe making an init.d script would be better though.
12:52 < innociv_> But I still don't get why that stop line doesn't work
13:19 < innociv_> http://pastebin.com/X8EVpZwS Can anyone tell me why this monit config doesn't work?  The program isn't being stopped, when I see the pidid matching what's in the pidfile of the program that's using too much cpu.  It's a node script that's started with forever --pidFile

14:59 < qballer> Hey guys, I was wandering. How do you implement polymorphism in node.js I need it to run on the browser as well. I've been researching for a while now and can't find something golden.
15:06 < bnoordhuis> qballer: you don't but you can inspect the type of your arguments
15:09 < qballer> I can't implement poly in js? I understood it's possible I just don't know how to do it. 
15:09 < qballer> bnoordhuis
15:10 < bradleymeck> qballer: prototypes, function Animal() {}; function Dog(){Animal.call(this);}; Dog.prototype = new Animal; Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog; // require('utils') does this in inherits
15:14 < technocrat> actually it does more than this, as youre creating here an instance of the sup class, which is mostly incorrect
15:15 < bradleymeck> technocrat, creating instance of superclass as prototype is for ie7- which don't like Object.create
15:15 < bradleymeck> and dont have __proto__
15:15 < bradleymeck> he said in browser too
15:16 < technocrat> just create a middle instance with a prototype set to super and inherit from that
15:16 < qballer> thanks guys

15:25 < pheuter> technocrat: i'll give it a try, thanks!
15:47 < owen1> SubStack: what exactly do u mean that in ruby you need to sync the class variables? also, in node, if u have 2 processes, how do u keep your var state = {} in sync?

16:22 < ctult> How would I install docco-husky on a Windows computer?

16:26 < cletus> is it feasible to write an iterator with nodejs?
16:26 < ctult> It can't run the .sh file.
16:26 < cletus> i cant seem to do it without getting caught in a mess of callbacks
16:26 < ctult> I wish I had my mac.
16:27 < freewil> cletus, check out the async module
16:28 < cletus> freewil: I have, and I saw this thing called method called iterator, but it doesnt really fit my use case
16:29 < cletus> I'm trying to recreate a python-esque iterator, where you just keep calling obj.next() until it throws an error
16:29 < WarheadsSE> ctult: it's apparently not liking  node 0.8.x on my win7 box
16:29 < WarheadsSE> seems commander is a problem
16:29 < freewil> cletus, https://github.com/caolan/async#forEach
16:30 < freewil> or forEachSeries if the iterator needs to execute in order for each item in the array
16:30 < tuhoojabotti> http://urly.fi/2tg do not click

16:40 < gicode> The npm FAQ recommends checking in node_modules.  What is the recommended strategy for modules with native components?
16:42 < bnoordhuis> gicode: npm rebuild
16:43 < gicode> bnoordhuis: Ah, thanks :-)
16:43 < AAA_awright> gicode: Where is this?

16:44 < gicode> https://npmjs.org/doc/faq.html#Should-I-check-my-node_modules-folder-into-git
16:46 < AAA_awright> hmm
16:46 < AAA_awright> gicode: I'd use git submodules in all cases, and especially don't check-in dependencies for libraries, only applications if you must
16:47 < ctult> Has anyone tried to compile docco-husky for windows?
16:47 < AAA_awright> gicode: And native components, whatever you do, don't check in compiled binaries
16:48 < AAA_awright> gitignore is useful for that
16:48 < TheRedMood> Hey
16:48 < gicode> AAA_awright: I am not a fan of submodules, but the rest of that is in line with my thoughts
16:49 < AAA_awright> Are submodules just more work or what? People tend to not like it
16:49 < TheRedMood> If i want to write a chat server in node
16:49 < AAA_awright> I'm contemplating getting started on a git subcommand to help manage submodule depenencies
16:49 < TheRedMood> and i want it to run thorugh a browser like webchat.freenode.net , what technologies do i need to look into?
16:49 < TheRedMood> Other than node
16:50 < gicode> AAA_awright: I use repo tool on large projects.  For a node app, checking in the modules makes sense to me.
16:51 < AAA_awright> gicode: The only problem with checking in external dependencies is you lose all of their revision history, you lose a lot of meaning
16:51 < AAA_awright> TheRedMood: The web browser thing is a chat client, so, consider developing them seperately?
16:52 < TheRedMood> AAA_awright: I actully knew that, but I am wondering what i need to learn to do that
16:52 < AAA_awright> I'm not sure where to start, that touches on HTTP, protocols, TCP, etc
16:52 < TheRedMood> okey
16:52 < AAA_awright> Is this IRC or a new protocol?
16:52 < gicode> AAA_awright: It isn't "lost" and if I am debugging, I am probably comparing the the last version I used anyways
16:52 < TheRedMood> I am trying to build a shell in node
16:52 < TheRedMood> ANd i want it to be avalible over a browser
16:53 < TheRedMood> I still have a lot to learn about node and web development
16:53 < TheRedMood> But having goals is good
16:53 < TheRedMood> I was looking at something like
16:53 < TheRedMood> socket.io
16:53 < TheRedMood> BUt i don't know about using modules before i know node better
16:54 < TheRedMood> AAA_awright: Do i need to know ajax?
16:55 < AAA_awright> TheRedMood: I tried to work on a browser-based, terminal-based, and/or desktop-based IRC client and generic chat server, I gave up :p
16:55 < AAA_awright> I'll resume it a bit later but I realized there's more important things
16:55 < AAA_awright> AJAX is just pulling data from a webpage when it needs it
16:56 < TheRedMood> okey.
16:56 < TheRedMood> Could it be an idea to use socket.io for the front end?
16:56 < AAA_awright> chat is mostly conserned with push, so you're looking at... pushing, long-polling, websockets, the tech doesn't have a name, just the various ways to implement it
16:56 < AAA_awright> Socket.io handles all that for you
16:56 < TheRedMood> ohh
16:56 < TheRedMood> Okey
16:57 < TheRedMood> But should i not use it to learn more about node js?
16:57 < AAA_awright> Also take notw that socket.io isn't a stateless protocol
16:57 < AAA_awright> There's an important and sharp distinction between RESTful protocols like HTTP, and push-based streams like websockets
16:58 < AAA_awright> which are stateful
16:59 < TheRedMood> I want the later one. Am i correct?
16:59 < AAA_awright> A chat application is one of the rare single-page apps that makes sense to fully implement with the latter, yeah
17:00 < ctult> What good code documentation tools are there for Node? (like Javadoc)
17:00 < bradgignac> jsdoc
17:00 < bradgignac> docco
17:00 < AAA_awright> You could implement it all in URIs and HTTP, but it would be impractical and most web browsers probably don't support the HTTP headers necessary to do it anyways (go figure)
17:00 < TheRedMood> but
17:01 < TheRedMood> Should i use sockets.io or should i try to do it by myself?
17:01 < TheRedMood> To learn more of node
17:01 < AAA_awright> i.e. you could have each new message be a resource that you GET, and all new updates are pulled down with a Content-Location header, giving each line in each channel a unique URI
17:01 < ctult> jsdoc isn't for Node...
17:01 < AAA_awright> ctult: Node is, in fact, Javascript
17:02 < ctult> It appears that JSdoc only works for Rhino which isn't, in fact, Node.
17:03 < gicode> ctult: The tool runs in rhino, but it just processes JS code.  So your code can be for node.
17:04 < TheRedMood> AAA_awright: okey. I will try to do more stuff with node and I will get back once i got more internet
17:04 < TheRedMood> AAA_awright: Thanks a lot for the tips and help!
17:04 < AAA_awright> ctult: Rhino is just another Javascript engine iirc
17:04 < ctult> gicode, IK, but I am looking for an entirely Node-based solution.
17:05 < ctult> I will probably go with Docco if I am able to deploy it on Windows as well as Mac and Linux.
17:05 < AAA_awright> I don't see how you can write code "just for Rhino" which makes about as much sense as "Just for V8" (so maybe it does but it'd have to use some pretty exotic features of ES)
17:05 < totallymike> ctult: I don't know of one that exists.  JSDoc is good enough though, if you don't mind your machine having rhino on it.
17:05 < gicode> AAA_awright: Basically just the IO
17:05 < AAA_awright> Which V8 and Rhino don't supply?
17:05 < totallymike> Where you're trying to build a project that uses Node, JSDoc is built using Rhino.  Rhino's presence in the tool has nothing to do with what you use it for.
17:06 < gicode> AAA_awright: Rhino is like Node, it is a full package, not just a scripting engine like V8.
17:06 < AAA_awright> ah
17:06 < AAA_awright> So what am I thinking of then
17:06 < gkatsev> rhino also has access to all of the jvm
17:06 < AAA_awright> Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written entirely in Java. It is typically embedded into Java applications to provide scripting to end users. It is embedded in J2SE 6 as the default Java scripting engine.
17:06 < ctult> I can't intergrate it with my Node code and that is why I would rather use something entirely Node-base.
17:07 < totallymike> ctult: no
17:07 < AAA_awright> ctult: Obviously you don't want jsdoc but it can't hurt to explore the possibility
17:07 < totallymike> JSDoc is a tool.  It happens to be built on Rhino.  That's all.
17:07 < freewil> there is jsdoc too
17:08 < freewil> i mean jsduck
17:08 < totallymike> Your javascript, whether it's written for node, the browser, or couch, is still javascript.
17:08 < totallymike> Probably couch functions are structured differently, but the point is if you put valid javadoc-style comments in your JS, it doesn't matter what the target is.
17:08 < totallymike> JSDoc can generate docs for it.
17:08 < ctult> No, I need something where I can access and deploy everything entirely from Node.
17:11 < ctult> so, totallymike, it needs to be entirely compatible with Node.
17:11 < ctult> Or I need some easy way of deploying jsdoc
17:12 < gicode> ctult: https://github.com/p120ph37/node-jsdoc-toolkit
17:12 < ctult> Oh that works
17:15 < ctult> should I install this package: https://npmjs.org/package/hoarders
17:16 < freewil> absolutely
17:17 < ctult> How big is that package?
17:17 < ctult> More than 1G?
17:19 < totallymike> hoarders looks more like a joke than something that should actually be deployed ;)
17:20 < ctult> I know.
17:20 < ctult> But it is good if you dislike installing dependencies on your test server
17:21 < lz> ctult, absolutely
17:22 < lz> it has everything you'll ever need
17:22 < totallymike> heh
17:22 < lz> what a great package
17:22 < ctult> almost everything
17:24 < mscdex> anyone know how expensive the crypto.create* functions are?
17:24 < totallymike> Really I think it'd be better for your project to have a package.json that handles the dependencies for you.  Then when you deploy your code you can just run npm install and you get what you need.

17:35 < ctult> Should I use LESS or SASS?
17:35 < maxogden> i like css
17:36 < gkatsev> stylus?
17:37 < freewil> havent used stylus
17:37 < freewil> not a fan of required braces with less
17:37 < gkatsev> there's also scss
17:37 < freewil> thats an extended version of sass isnt it
17:38 < gkatsev> or something
17:38 < EnosFeedler> if i run a node process on linux as root i see two running node processes when using 'ps' command.  is this behavior unique to node or is this something more general in ubuntu?
17:39 < jocafa> stylus ftw
17:39 < Domenic_> stylus is great
17:39 < Domenic_> but if you're choosing sass >>> less
17:39 < bradgignac> i agree with sass over less
17:40 < Domenic_> also if you have to develop for downlevel browsers compass might make sass win over stylus
17:40 < bradgignac> unless you don't want to introduce ruby into your project
17:40 < Domenic_> there's no javascript sass yet? lame
17:41 < gkatsev> there isn't?
17:42 < gkatsev> guess there isn't
17:42 < bradgignac> not 100% sure about that
17:43 < robinson_k> with the help of google i found some projects, first link: https://github.com/andrew/node-sass/
17:44 < gkatsev> nothing officially sanctioned
17:44 < ctult> Should I use plates or EJS? (or something else?)
17:45 < Domenic_> plates is... a matter of taste... i think it's a horrible idea
17:45 < Domenic_> ejs is very raw
17:45 < Domenic_> i love jade
17:45 < Domenic_> it's kind of the opposite of ejs
17:45 < Domenic_> very sugary
17:45 < gkatsev> plates sound like something you put your food on when you eat :P
17:47 < bradgignac> i prefer ejs or eco

18:02 < LambdaDusk> is it possible to get a file upload as a stream in expressjs?
18:05 < maxogden> request objects are readable streams
18:06 < LambdaDusk> maxogden: But they're not parsed as multipart in that case, right?
18:06 < maxogden> you didnt mention that :)
18:06 < maxogden> there is a module called formidable if you need to parse multipart
18:07 < benatkin> https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable/
18:08 < livinded> you can always use html filereader to submit base64 encoded files via a post
18:08 < LambdaDusk> maxogden: Afaik that's also used by connect and therefore express... hmm
18:08 < maxogden> livinded: you dont have to base64 encode them
18:08 < LambdaDusk> livinded: I wanted to do that but you know, Internet Explorer
18:09 < Domenic_> ctult: i just thought of an explanation for your localhostiness. recently demonoid (the torrent tracker) has been down and been redirecting to local host. so maybe mcaffee automated telemetrics have been flagging localhost as a torrent tracker
18:09 < livinded> maxogden: is it safe to send binary like that?
18:09 < maxogden> livinded: what do you mean 'safe'?
18:09 < livinded> I thought even multipart was base64 encoded
18:09 < livinded> like just dropping binary data into the data section of a post
18:09 < maxogden> http supports binary data, yes
18:10 < livinded> ah, didn't know that
18:10 < LambdaDusk> never knew that
18:10 < maxogden> multipart can be any mimetype you want
18:10 < livinded> I thought multipart file uploads were always base64 encoded
18:10 < livinded> LambdaDusk: does ie10 support filereader?
18:10 < Domenic_> don't use multipart unless you are actually uploading form data along with a file
18:10 < maxogden> in one terminal window do nc -l 8080 and in another do curl -X POST --data-binary @somefilename localhost:8080
18:10 < LambdaDusk> livinded: I don't know, but I take no chances there
18:10 < Domenic_> if you are just uploading a file just sent the binary data as the body payload
18:11 < LambdaDusk> I am thinking of using several methods for several browsers
18:11 < maxogden> there are some tricks in browsers that you have to do
18:11 < livinded> LambdaDusk: I'm actually working on a library to do that
18:12 < livinded> handles nice html 5 drag and drop uploading
18:12 < maxogden> livinded: i just wrote https://github.com/maxogden/dataroller last week
18:12 < maxogden> livinded: does binary uploads and saves responses as files all in html5
18:12 < LambdaDusk> livinded: Interesting. But I hope it is not too high-level so it can be integrated into other sites
18:13 < livinded> LambdaDusk: the idea is that you just pass it the dropzone you want to use, some other configuration options, and it just sets it all up for you
18:13 < LambdaDusk> livinded: I want to have a classic button as well
18:14 < livinded> LambdaDusk: planning to add support for that as well as a fallback
18:14 < LambdaDusk> and I really need to find some good docs on that new HTML5 webcam stuff - for direct photos
18:14 < maxogden> https://github.com/maxogden/domnode-usermedia implements that api as a stream
18:15 < livinded> LambdaDusk: it's really crappy right now. I was trying to get video/audio streaming working a few months back when it landed in chrome canary and didn't get very far
18:15 < maxogden> video is more stable but has a slow framerate and audio isnt implemented yet
18:15 < nlf> krtconf and redisconf tickets up for sale - http://2012.krtconf.com http://redisconf.com
18:15 < livinded> you have to do this stupid hacky shit to get video where you pull frames from a canvas rather than piping the raw data
18:15 < nlf> </shameless plug>
18:15 < maxogden> livinded: thats why the framerate is slow
18:16 < livinded> maxogden: right
18:16 < Domenic_> LambdaDusk: HTML5 doctor usually has great articles on the newest APIs
18:16 < LambdaDusk> Domenic_: thanks
18:17 < LambdaDusk> but I basically just wanted to know if file uploads can be easily made a stream so they never touch my hard disk before I shove them over to the cloud store
18:18 < livinded> LambdaDusk: if that's what you want to do I'm implement file uploads all as xhr requests
18:18 < LambdaDusk> livinded: Which I am not sure works in all browsers, though...
18:18 < maxogden> you dont need xhr to do streaming upload
18:18 < maxogden> but if you want to parse multipart use formidable. i dont know how to use it from within connect or whatever though
18:19 < LambdaDusk> what I thought of is the same "endpoint" in my app, whereas the js in the site uses different APIs, dependend on browser
18:19 < jmartins> what you think about dust.js?
18:20 < nlf> it's a little.. dry
18:20 < nlf> zing!
18:20 < LambdaDusk> jmartins: It's interesting, but it's not maintained for months and incompatible with current node
18:20 < livinded> what's the reason to use it over mustache?
18:21 < LambdaDusk> livinded: Async logic in the templates
18:21 < livinded> ah
18:22 < LambdaDusk> livinded: dust allows for async functions in the template interpolation so you can put data loading in there - very interesting, but alas, dust itself is not usable due to the lack of maintaining
18:23 < zipp_> Lambda, take over the project. Fork it! :P
18:25 < LambdaDusk> zipp_: Nah, I don't really feel like taking over a project I don't now anything about, trying to work into code I don't understand. Also I stole the idea and built it in Haskell
18:26 < jmartins> lambdaDusk: there is a linkedin fork see https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs/
18:27 < LambdaDusk> jmartins: Then you're good. I didn't know that
18:27 < jmartins> LambdaDusk: tks! kkkkkkk
18:28 < jmartins> LambdaDusk: can you see http://linkedin.github.com/dustjs/
18:28 < LambdaDusk> jmartins: Yeah just saw it.
18:40 < mape> Has anyone had issues with if you delete the require.cache and require the file it throws unexpected token, but the first require works just fine?
18:40 < mape> (know that deleting require.cache is horrible but still)
18:41 < DarkArgon> no
18:42 < DarkArgon> i have a bot with modules, and a reload function for it
18:42 < DarkArgon> no problem with that
18:42 < bradleymeck> mape have not seen that happen, are you sure the unexpected token is from node and not some other thing registered to the file extension after startup
18:43 < DarkArgon> u sure u do it like this? var a= require.resolve("./name"); delete require.cache[a];
18:43 < diversario> Using vm.runInNewContext,(myModule) I want to check the global variables inside of myModule. It appears that after being initialized, they aren't reflecting changes that module's function make to them.
18:45 < diversario> mape, i'm doing `delete require.cache['path'] and it works fine for me
18:50 < ctult> What would be the fastest way to check the file extension of a file?
18:50 < mape> diversario: Hmm k, strange thing is that I can reload it like 5 times in a row, and the 6th it breaks
18:50 < devaholic> ctult: require('path')
18:51 < diversario> mape, do you the unexpected token? what is it?
18:51 < mape> diversario: });
18:52 < mape> which isn't to useful, and the line it points to isn't });
18:52 < adamramadhan> hello how can i wait .match is done? how can i make a callback from `something = input.html.match('<title>(.+)</title>');` becouse sometimes it works sometimes it returns the full html, is it asyc too?
18:52 < diversario> I think I've seen something like that before... just maybe not in require
18:52 < diversario> I think my issue was that file wasn't loading fully
18:52 < stagas> mape: that's added by the require wrapper, so the file probably isn't read in full
18:53 < stagas> mape: for some strange reason
18:53 < adamramadhan> is there something like .match(html,callback) ?
18:53 < adamramadhan> i mean .match(regex,callback)
18:53 < mape> stagas: ah yeah, it is big, 3.7k lines
18:53 < diversario> mape, that could be it
18:53 < mape> but seems strange it would work first require and not the second
18:53 < diversario> mape, are you reading it from disk?
18:54 < mape> yeah? require('./file.js')
18:56 < stagas> mape: maybe it runs out of memory and fails to read that big file at some point. try not deleting the cache property, set it to '' before you require again
18:56 < mape> k
18:56 < ctult> How would I load all files in a folder into an object?
18:56 < stagas> mape: delete may not trigger the gc immediately and free the memory
18:56 < mape> stagas: no difference
18:56 < stagas> set to '' then delete
18:56 < gicode> Is there an easy way to get a list of all the outputs from npm rebuild so I can .gitignore them?
18:57 < mape> stagas: same
18:57 < diversario> mape, are you re-requiring because you file is changing?
18:57 < mape> diversario: yeah
18:58 < mape> oh, guess it might be that I'm saving over network and it triggers on first change, duh
18:58 < stagas> mape: yeah that's it
18:58 < Peter__> Does anyone know if there's a way to send the headers for an HTTP POST request without using .write() or .end()? 
18:58 < diversario> mape, there we go
18:59 < diversario> mape, you can just wrap your require in try/catch and retry until it's loaded
18:59 < diversario> mape, this way if network is slow you still can load it
18:59 < mape> yup
19:00 < stagas> diversario: what if the point where it's saved doesn't throw an error?
19:00 < bradleymeck> Peter__: .writeHead(statusCode, {headers})
19:00 < diversario> stagas, that'd be unfortunate :)
19:00 < mape> I just added a timer
19:00 < mape> not production so won't matter if it breaks every now and then
19:01 < mape> or well, not a service for other people then me
19:02 < Peter__> bradletmeck: That's for the server end, right? I'm trying to have the client just send its headers. Like http.request(...).writeHead(200) would be exactly what i need, but I can't seem to find anything like that.
19:06 < diversario> Ok, so with VM, the sandbox properties aren't shared with the "parent" script. And changes are copied onto sandbox object after it runs. Is there a way to poke around in the context as it runs? I need this for testing.

19:12 < rsmol> hi, I am new to JS and node. Is it OK, to write code, that will just keep calling itself (endless recursion)?
19:12 < ctult> depends on what it does.
19:12 < ctult> If you gave us a pastebin
19:12 < ctult> that would help.
19:13 < bradleymeck> rsmol: there is no tail call optimization due to some language semantics, so don't do that
19:13 < EyePulp> rsmol: endless recursion is not ok.
19:13 < gkatsev> only ended recursion please
19:13 < EyePulp> exactly
19:13 < rsmol> http://pastebin.com/ZmiVvNCf
19:13 < EyePulp> =)
19:14 < ctult> I wasn't saying that is was ever good btw.
19:14 < rsmol> I want to call URL (that does some computation and returns next_poll in seconds), I want to call it again after next_poll of seconds
19:14 < gkatsev> though, you could have endless recursion via a trampoline
19:14 < EyePulp> rsmol: that's not recursion - the setTimeout makes it async.  
19:14 < ctult> Yeah
19:15 < EyePulp> rsmol: and though it's not necessarily a "good" method to do what you want, it's perfectly acceptable I think
19:17 < EyePulp> rsmol: and actually, you'd want to put the next call within the callback function of the http.get, so you're only making one call at time.
19:18 < EyePulp> rsmol: http://pastebin.com/Py2jbKwZ
19:19 < EyePulp> something organized like that
19:23 < jcrew> endless recursion is winning
19:23 < jcrew> if it's not endless then it is futile and hopeless
19:36 < alex-ku> I wonder if it's possible to use nodejs as a pure js interpreter (the documentation does not seem to state that explicitly)?
19:43 < gkatsev> ?
19:44 < qballer> is their any alternative to binaryjs
19:50 < gicode> alex-ku: What do you mean "pure-js"?
19:52 < rsmol> EyePulp: many thanks
19:52 < EyePulp> rsmol: np
19:53 < alex-ku> gicode, just a js repl
19:54 < TheNumb> alex-ku: why not?
19:55 < tmpvar> does the windows installer drop a log somewhere? I'm working with someone who is having trouble installing on win7 pro
19:55 < alex-ku> TheNumb, So, it could simulate a browser?
19:56 < TheNumb> alex-ku: not really. It can parse js code though ;p
19:56 < alex-ku> TheNumb, The goal I have is testing some javascript code which would be deployed in a browser.
19:59 < TheNumb> alex-ku: try it
19:59 < TheNumb> might work ;-)
20:02 < tprice> ho can i join #javascript?
20:02 < tprice> it that the right chan?
20:07 < WarheadsSE> TooTallNate: ding, saw my comment on that closed issue for the RPi?
20:23 < maxogden> isaacs: https://gist.github.com/3307779
20:28 < TooTallNate> WarheadsSE: what's up now?
20:31 < WarheadsSE> Not much, just know you're going to be fidgeting with it on the RPi
20:31 < TooTallNate> WarheadsSE: can you link to me this comment?
20:31 < WarheadsSE> v6 is more likely (depending on the kernel build opts) to accept unaligned pages, but you might hit odd segfaults in v8 startup
20:32 < WarheadsSE> https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3742#issuecomment-7594443
20:32 < WarheadsSE> no need to re-open, but educational none the less
20:33 < TooTallNate> WarheadsSE: so can't we fix the V8 bug?
20:34 < maxogden> isaacs: https://gist.github.com/3307779
20:35 < WarheadsSE> TooTallNate: I haven't had time to dig in deep enough. I can show you the gdb fault if you like?
20:36 < TooTallNate> WarheadsSE: I'm not really the person to show :p but maybe we should open an issue on the V8 tracker to get them on it
20:37 < WarheadsSE> Yeah, have to find time :)
20:37 < WarheadsSE> its kinda the nature of the issue. It gets around forcing no-unaligned-pages, which is possible, and happens intermittently
20:39 < TooTallNate> I still haven't gotten around to using node on my pi too extensively yet
20:41 < NBL> hey guys
20:41 < TooTallNate> the lack of a good git reading module makes me :(
20:41 < WarheadsSE> I've yet to hit anything really nasty, except for people loving to hard set ia32 optimizations in their c bindings
20:41 < TooTallNate> haha
20:41 < WarheadsSE> "git reading module"
20:41 < TooTallNate> lovely
20:41 < maxogden> TooTallNate: yea many libgit2 bindings projects have started and died
20:42 < TooTallNate> i really liked gitteh
20:42 < TooTallNate> but it hasn't been updated in a while
20:42 < TooTallNate> ls
20:42 < TooTallNate> whoops
20:42  * WarheadsSE is not the only one that does ^
20:44 < TooTallNate> i think my best hope is to revive gitteh
20:44 < TooTallNate> but chriskv's looks nice (but neglected) as well
20:45 < TooTallNate> ughh
20:45 < maxogden> i liked tbranyen's
20:49 < WarheadsSE> im guessing it didn't migrate up from 0.6.x
20:51 < stephank> mscdex: Since you mentioned you were also working on an ssh implementation, I decided to upload what I have so far to github: https://github.com/stephank/sshiny
20:51 < stephank> I'm not that far; at the moment trying to complete a key exchange using a hardcoded set of algos.
20:52 < TooTallNate> stephank: pure js?
20:53 < stephank> TooTallNate: that's the goal
20:53 < alex-ku> If I have something like Packages.org.mozilla.javascript.Context.<stuff>, how do I make it available to scripts running in nodejs?
20:53 < alex-ku> Rhino does not complain at objects referenced like that.
20:53 < maxogden> i dunno

20:55 < alex-ku> TomRone, so, just npm install java ?
20:56 <@TooTallNate> alex-ku: that's a module that accesses java from node. as to Packages.org.mozilla.javascript.Context.<stuff>, you'd need to implement that on top of "java"
20:57 < NeoTech> Aloha, i just tried the installers for windows, both x86 and x64.. and both just "ends prematurely" with an unspecificed error.. I run a Windows 7 Pro, 64bit machine. Ive tried several versions of the installer - and its all the same.. Some error messages would be great. =)
20:58 < alex-ku> TooTallNate, do you mean that I will have to implement Packages.org.mozilla.<whatever> on my own or that I will have to implement some sort of access method on my own?
20:58 <@TooTallNate> alex-ku: https://npmjs.org/package/java
20:58 <@TooTallNate> check out the readme, it'll explain more
20:58 < gicode> alex-ku: You have to implement your own or use the java module TooTallNate linked
20:58 <@TooTallNate> i've never used that module personally, but it sounds like you're wanting to access java from node
21:00 < alex-ku> TooTallNate, I almost understand.  I did find a jar with that object; hence I shouldn't implement anything if I use node-java.  Is this correct?
21:04 < mscdex> stephank: i haven't pushed any of my pure js client implementation yet, but i have most of the key exchange stuff worked out
21:05 < stephank> neat :)
21:10 < gicode> Is the new mac installer 32-bit or 64-bit?
21:12 < sc30317> hey everyone
21:12 < sc30317> I have a node.js server that I want to make sure stays up all the time
21:12 < sc30317> is there a good way to do this?  Liveliness checks? etc.
21:13 < elijah-mbp> use something like pingdom with a regex that hunts a known-good value on a page?
21:13 < elijah-mbp> you don't want just a tcp check, that won't be enough
21:13 < elijah-mbp> for most people it won't, at least.
21:13 < sc30317> elijah-mbp, I have 2 servers actually - one for TCP and one for HTTP
21:14 < sc30317> elijah-mbp, pingdom isnt FOSS
21:14 < elijah-mbp> best practice is that you should check in such a way that you can both connect to the tcp port (including whatever port you're running the http protocol over) as well as a content check ;)
21:14 < sc30317> was looking for a free solution
21:14 < elijah-mbp> sc30317: then use nagios' check_apache
21:14 < sc30317> got it
21:14 < elijah-mbp> and be done :)
21:14 < elijah-mbp> there are about 9000 ways to skin this cat ;)
21:14 < elijah-mbp> some folks don't want to run their own monitoring ;)
21:15 < sc30317> cool
21:19 < sc30317> elijah-mbp, can you use nagios check_apache for node.js?
21:22 < elijah-mbp> sc30317: it should work fine.  it just speaks TCP/IP and HTTP.  it might not do everything you want if you have some sort of websockets requirement.  
21:22 < elijah-mbp> but it should work for making sure that stuff is up and running.
21:22 < elijah-mbp> (and the websockets bit - well, i can't think of a reason for it not to work there, too...)
21:22 < elijah-mbp> anyway.

22:00 < innociv_> Oh
22:00 < innociv_> I don't have a /usr/bin/kill
22:01 < devaholic> innociv_: you already asked that
22:01 < innociv_> I know
22:01 < WarheadsSE> TooTallNate: :) just confirmed by attempting to spawn 30 d8's (spawn faster, cause same segfault) .. does not happen ont he Pi
22:02 < WarheadsSE> So, you'll be safe to hack away without this annoyance
22:04 < garthk> TooTallNate: dumb question. Where do I put the libexpat source so I can build your gyp-ified version of node-expat?
22:06 <@TooTallNate> garthk: i usually put them in ./deps/*
22:07 <@TooTallNate> https://github.com/rbranson/node-ffi/tree/master/deps/libffi
22:07 <@TooTallNate> but then you have to hand-craft a gyp for it, which can be hard depending on the complexity of the lib
22:10 < garthk> TooTallNate: isn't this one? https://github.com/astro/node-expat/pull/40
22:11 <@TooTallNate> garthk: oh, well that one just expects you to have it installed somewhere in the default gcc path
22:11 <@TooTallNate> i.e. use the package manager
22:11 <@TooTallNate> garthk: what operating system?
22:12 < garthk> TooTallNate: Windows. I want to write UNIX and Windows command line scripts using node. Deployment on Windows is the hard part.
22:13 < garthk> I'll try the tools/ stuff andreasbotsikas added. https://github.com/astro/node-expat/tree/master/tools
22:13 < garthk> … though, then I'll have to figure out where to put the results to use the binaries.
22:14 < garthk> +1 to any proposals to have NPM just pull DLLs on Windows if necessary. 
22:15 < mscdex> -1 to XML
22:15 < mscdex> ;-)
22:22 < s5fs> aww, i kinda like xml
22:22 < EhevuTov> out
22:23 < s5fs> i've worked a lot with soap services, you gotta cut me some slack. therapy takes time.
22:23 < wereHamster> can someone explain how this works: https://gist.github.com/2a0c24d58f53ab7c19d0 ?
22:23 < EhevuTov> computers and humans generally dislike XML :-)
22:23 < wereHamster> how can there be only one 'calling fn' and four 'done calling fn' ?
22:24 < s5fs> EhevuTov: using C# and soap feels pretty natural since you're already worrying about types, aside from that it's a dream not fully realized
22:25 < s5fs> same goes with java and soap
22:25 < EhevuTov> computers don't like to parse XML
22:25 < EhevuTov> and it's hard for humans to read compared to other formats
22:25 < s5fs> other formats such as what?
22:25 < EhevuTov> JSOn
22:26 < s5fs> also, why is xml harder to parse than xml?
22:27 < EyePulp> lolwut?
22:27 < s5fs> sorry, xml harder than html
22:27 < jrajav> Computers don't like to parse XML?
22:27 < Hotroot> It's a strange feeling when the hacky solution is more efficient than the elegant one
22:27 < jrajav> Tell that to every Java developer ever
22:28 < EyePulp> xml is easier, typically, because it's got more restrictions. html is generally pretty loose.
22:28 < Hotroot> For example, telnet ends every data send with a CR then LB in ascii
22:28 < Hotroot> So I can either clean those out of the data sent, or just do theBuffer.size - 2 when converting
22:29 < Hotroot> Feels horribly hacky, but it's 0 performance loss vs a bunch of string searching
22:29 < jrajav> Hotroot: You might be confusing "elegant" with "robust" in this case
22:29 < wereHamster> why would this: console.log('x'); fn(); console.log('y') output 'xyyyyy' ? This doesn't make any sense...
22:29 < Hotroot> jrajav: "Proper" I suppose
22:29 < jrajav> Hotroot: "Robust and maintainable" even
22:30 < Hotroot> Yeah
22:30 < Hotroot> But it's pretty amazing, a solution with literally 0 performance hit
22:30 < jrajav> In general, robust and maintainable code is tailored towards human understanding and mitigating human error
22:30 < jrajav> Rather than optimizing for machine performance
22:30 < s5fs> jrajav: agreed
22:30 < Hotroot> Okay, robust then
22:30 < s5fs> hardware is cheap, developer time is expensive
22:31 < Hotroot> As long as I leave a comment, it shouldn't confuse anyone, or make it harder to maintain
22:31 < Hotroot> Telnet always ends it with CR LB, so I can't see a problem
22:31 < jrajav> Well, in this case you're dealing with a very stable and well-established protocol
22:32 < jrajav> But if that weren't the case I definitely wouldn't call it robust
22:32 < Hotroot> Yeah
22:32 < jrajav> If it does change, the comment won't matter a lot -- it'll be hard to track down the error
22:32 < Hotroot> Still feels hacky though. Not very dynamic
22:32 < Hotroot> Anything where it's fixed positioning feels a little hacky
22:32 < jrajav> You didn't start in C, did you? :P
22:32 < Hotroot> Haha, no, but I code in ASM on occasion
22:33 < Hotroot> But that's a different language. I get an ego boost when I find a hacky optimization in ASM
22:33 < Hotroot> In JS that satisfaction comes from elegance
22:34 < dnnsmanace> anyone using everyauth or some other authentication? i am trying to authenticate a user from a unique generated url and having trouble passing back that id with the facebook key
22:34 < Hotroot> Neat, works now, although I hit a DB error
22:36 < Hotroot> I'm guessing findOne gives an error in mongo if it doesn't find a match
22:37 < Hotroot> Sort of annoying. I would prefer it just not return a row
22:41 < ryanrolds_w> Anyone know if the SummerCamp campout tickets are still available?
22:42 < s5fs> ryanrolds_w: they were sold out 1-2wks ago when I looked
22:42 < s5fs> oh wait, sorry.. not campout tickets
22:44 < s5fs> ryanrolds_w: https://tito.io/nodeconf/nodeconf-summercamp  best info i could find
22:46 < ccowan> These girls just stopped by my door and sold me a coupon book worth $50,0000 for only $25... I totally robbed them blind. I don't think they read the cover... it says $50,000 worth of coupons!
22:46 < zastern> Is anybody familiar with the ubuntu node.js PPA? Anybody know where it's setting the NODE_PATH environment variable? because it is being set, and even editing /etc/environment isn't overriding it
22:47 < ccowan> zastern: you can just set the env setting when you call node
22:48 < zastern> ccowan: i'm not the dev unfortunately
22:48 < ccowan> like NODE_PATH=/where/ever/you/want node scriptname.js
22:48 < ryanrolds_w> s5fs: Yeah, they have the signifiacant other tickets and the semi-private room tickets. I'm curious about the reduced rate non-so campout (bring your own test) tickets.
22:48 < zastern> so I can actually execute a command like this: NODE_PATH="foo:bar:thing:" somecommand someargument?
22:48 < zastern> on onel ine?
22:48 < zastern> i didn't know that
22:48 < ccowan> yup
22:49 < s5fs> ryanrolds_w: that page had the non-SO tickets listed for a while (but not the room, said it was sold out) so I'm guessing the campout is sold out too. I'd email mikeal.
22:50 < ryanrolds_w> s5fs: Thanks. Should have jumped earlier.
22:51 < zastern> ccowan: if i'm sudoing something, does the variable go before the sudo, or after the sudo but before the command?
22:51 < s5fs> ryanrolds_w: same :-/
22:53 < pringlescan1> Howdy, I'm using an Async queue for reading over a hundred thousand text files… and without even opening the files, it's taking up 2gb of ram and slowing to a crawl before the directory's contents are even added into the queue. Any ideas?
22:54 < SubStack> pringlescan1: with fs.readdir?
22:54 < pringlescan1> SubStack, yessir.
22:55 <@maxogden> by 'Async queue' do you mean require('async').queue ?
22:55 < SubStack> what if you just node -e "require('fs').readdir('.')" in that directory?
22:56 < ccowan> zastern: if you are goign to do sudo the I would do this:
22:56 < Hotroot> Thought of throttling it? I'm pretty noob, but I assume you could just tell it to start the next batch of 50k when the first batch ends
22:56 < ccowan> sudo sh -c "NODE_PATH=/whatever node script.js"
22:57 < Hotroot> Or less, or more, whatever
22:57 < pringlescan1> Substack, that works… I'm frustrated ls and mv don't even work "arugment list too long" errors. I'm never making a mess on my FS like this again.
22:57 <@maxogden> pringlescan1: so you can get a js object containing all 100k filenames into memory without using 2gb ram?
22:57 < ccowan> zastern: Are you runnig the command as root or are you goign to sudo -u and run it as a different user?
22:57 < zastern> sudo -u
22:58 < zastern> im setting up an upstart
22:58 < ccowan> zastern: ok... just making sure...
22:58 < ccowan> ah!
22:58 < zastern> sudo -u is being used in an upstart script
22:58 < ccowan> That's how I do it in upstart
22:58 < Phoenixz> I use node v0.8.x cluster, I have a master and one worker. Now, I want to kill the worker but NOT the master. process.exit() in the worker will also kill the master?
22:58 < zastern> where do you place the NODE_PATH= though, 
22:58 < zastern> before the sudo, or after teh sudo and before the command
22:59 < SubStack> pringlescan1: can you gist your code?
22:59 < ccowan> scroll up
22:59 < stagas> pringlescan1: there was some talk that fs.readdir should be a stream, I guess that's why
22:59 < ccowan> sudo -u nobody sh -c "NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules node script.js"
23:00 < stagas> pringlescan1: maybe start a child process with ls and parse the stdout stream
23:02 < stagas> oh ls doesn't work also
23:02 < zastern> ccowan: so `sudo -u nobody sh -c "NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules node script.js" node /path/to/thing.js`
23:02 < jw> In the command line debugger, is the 'repeat last command if an empty empty line is about to be evaluated' still working?  I'm on 8.2 and it doesn't seem like it...
23:02 < zastern> right?
23:03 < SubStack> pringlescan1: are you doing something like this? https://gist.github.com/3308825
23:03 < zastern> whops
23:03 < zastern> i misread haha
23:03 < SubStack> seems like you could be buffering file contents someplace without meaning to
23:04 < ccowan> zastern: drop the last part after the last double quotes
23:04 < zastern> yeah. also our node path is diff
23:04 < zastern> but awesome
23:04 < zastern> this should work!
23:04 < ccowan> right
23:04 < ccowan> customize to your liking
23:04 < ccowan> :D
23:05 < zastern> ccowan: do I really need the sh -c
23:05 < zastern> why not `exec sudo -u www-data NODE_PATH="/usr/lib/" node /www/somedir/node/crawl.js
23:06 < zastern> ignoring the stupidity of using www-data for a minute
23:06 < benatkin> woot, just made a simple js program with this https://npmjs.org/package/hipster
23:06 < ccowan> yup
23:07 < ccowan> see if it will execute with out but I'm pretty sure the ENV variable won't get set properly
23:08 < ccowan> zastern: let me send you a gist of mine
23:08 < ccowan> give me a second
23:08 < ccowan> it works flawlessly
23:08 < zastern>  ccowan you da man
23:11 < ccowan>  https://gist.github.com/3308895
23:12 < ccowan> We still use capistrano to deploy so I have that as a template that installs during the deploy:setup phase
23:12 < SubStack> somebody with a mac, do this: echo $COLUMNS x $LINES
23:13 < zastern> ccowan: yeah the command i've constructed is just existing with no feedback, so im doing something wrong. I'll look at your gist!
23:13 < AvianFlu> SubStack: 167 x 40
23:13 < AvianFlu> in a fullscreened iterm2
23:13 < pandemic> SubStack: 104 x 25 
23:13 < pandemic> using default terminal
23:13 < zastern> ccowan: NODE_ENV vs NODE_PATH?
23:13 < pandemic> although i did resize it
23:14 < Phoenixz> I use node v0.8.x cluster, I have a master and one worker. Now, I want to kill the worker but NOT the master. process.exit() in the worker will also kill the master?
23:14 < blakmatrix_> SubStack: I get 158 x 46
23:14 < AvianFlu> Phoenixz: it shouldn't
23:14 < SubStack> AvianFlu, pandemic: sweet thanks!
23:14 < pandemic> np :)
23:14 < ccowan> SubStack: 272 x 70
23:14 < blakmatrix_> OS X 10.8 (12A269)
23:15 < SubStack> how about this:  echo `tput cols` x `tput lines`
23:15 < SubStack> should be the same
23:15 < SubStack> just verifying that this works on both linux and mac
23:15 < pandemic> 104 x 25
23:15 < SubStack> excellent
23:15 < blakmatrix_> 158 x 46
23:15 < ccowan> SubStack: it's the same except it just deleted my entire hard drive!
23:16 < othiym23> SubStack: 278 x 78, 278 x 78
23:16 < zastern> ccowan: the command works1
23:16 < zastern> i just have to test in upstat now!
23:16 < zastern> aaweeesome
23:16 < othiym23> my font size made isaacs cry when he saw it
23:17 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: With me it does kill the worker.. weird... 
23:17 < qballer> Have you guys integrated express with binary.js ?
23:17 < AAA_awright> Sometimes i'm getting 'data' events from a child process stdout.on('data') event *after* the on('exit') event
23:17 < AvianFlu> Phoenixz: kill the worker or kill the master?
23:17 < AAA_awright> Anyone know what's up here?
23:17 < AvianFlu> and are you exiting the worker or the master
23:17 < qballer> Like in this example https://github.com/binaryjs/binaryjs/blob/master/examples/fileupload/server.js
23:17 < AvianFlu> I might have misunderstood you
23:18 < AvianFlu> AAA_awright: if you're on 0.8
23:18 < AvianFlu> listen for 'close' instead of 'exit'
23:18 < AAA_awright> AvianFlu: Ah that would be it, thanks
23:18 < AAA_awright> It makes sense that it could do that but... really? There has to be a way to wait for everything to close
23:19 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: kill the master.. But I guess that if it should kill the worker, that I am doing something wrong
23:19 < AvianFlu> Phoenixz: if you kill the master, it kills the workers
23:20 < AvianFlu> AAA_awright: 'close' is there for that reason, so you can wait to close
23:20 < AvianFlu> 'exit' fires as soon as the process exits
23:20 < AvianFlu> it's now two events to avoid race conditions and weird hangs
23:20 < AAA_awright> Right
23:20 < AAA_awright> What would cause a race condition?
23:21 < Hotroot> An offensive racial comment?
23:21 < AvianFlu> the old behavior would sometimes hang
23:21 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: ah, I have to do cluster.worker.process.exit();
23:21 < AvianFlu> the race condition happens now, if you only listen to 'exit'
23:21 < Phoenixz> errr.. or not.. 
23:21 < AvianFlu> better control, really
23:25 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: cluster shows that its a worker, not the master. cluster.worker.process.exit(); does seem to kill the master though..
23:25 < simoon> anyone here use vim and coffee script??
23:25 < simoon> I'm having issues with coffee -cw *.coffee
23:25 < AvianFlu> Phoenixz: having the worker kill the master is strange
23:26 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: No idea how I am doing it :) cluster.isWorker is true, isMaster is false.. then cluster.worker.process.exit(); or just process.exit() does seem to kill the master anyway
23:26 < zastern> ccowan: actually the init script is causing two instances of node to run :(
23:26 < zastern> upstart rather
23:30 < Hotroot> I think there should be a holiday where we all appreciate how handy it is that TCP exists.
23:30 < CIA-93> node: Ben Noordhuis master * r9693d33 / src/node.cc : node: remove process.uvCounters() - http://git.io/yVXVhA
23:30 < ccowan> what does your upstart look like?
23:32 < zastern> ccowan: actually getting rid of the sh -c and quotes, it works now, and only starts one process
23:32 < ccowan> hum
23:32 < ccowan> you might have had two sets of quotes or not escaped
23:33 < ccowan> mine only spawns one instance
23:33 < zastern> could be. but it works now, without the sh
23:33 < zastern> https://gist.github.com/bcdf894e5f699376de03
23:33 < zastern> it wouldnt work as nobody, unfortunately
23:34 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: Should I maybe do process.exit() with a certain exit code to cause the restart?
23:35 < ccowan> this should have worked: https://gist.github.com/f600a16ae63067a46f3c
23:35 < zastern> ccowan: that's what we tried initially. it's possible that i made a typo.
23:35 < zastern> but since it works now, meh.
23:36 < ccowan> ok
23:36 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: Ah, I have cluster.on('death' .....) specified, but not cluster.on('exit' .....) Maybe thats the problem
23:36 < ccowan> You need to make sure your NODE_PATH got set correctly
23:37 < zastern> if it wasn't set correctly the process would fail.
23:41 < ccowan> are you sure it was spawning two instances of the same command
23:41 < ccowan> it shoudl create two processes
23:41 < ccowan> but they are not the same command
23:42 < ccowan> one is the sudo -u nobody sh -c
23:42 < ccowan> and the other is the sh -c (which is the actual node process)
23:43 < ccowan> in ps ax it looks a little wird
23:43 < ccowan> weird
23:43 < ccowan> but there is really only one node process
23:43 < ccowan> (unless you use cluster)
23:48 < tprice> whats with the topic name
23:50 < Phoenixz> AvianFlu: It was the missing cluster.on('exit')... I had .on(death), thought that that would do it
23:50 < AvianFlu> that makes sense
23:57 < ctult> lol that topic
