00:01 < othiym23> listochkin: if you're still around and still have questions about domain nesting, I can probably answer your question(s)
00:02 < listochkin> othiym23: I'm here :) reading old threads on NodeJS mailing list
00:02 < othiym23> listochkin: for starters, you can always check process.domain or require('domain').active to see if a function is executing inside a domain
00:03 < listochkin> othiym23: is it still around? I saw people mentioning that but neither of these are in the current API docs
00:03 < othiym23> as far as nesting is concerned, when you enter a domain (via d.run(), d.enter() or calling a function that's bound to the domain using d.bind()), it gets pushed onto a domain stack
00:04 < othiym23> when a domain is exited, all domains nested within that domain are also exited, and the error handler exits the domain
00:04 < othiym23> listochkin: they're not part of the official API, but they're not going anywhere
00:05 < listochkin> othiym23: ah, I see
00:05 < othiym23> I think they're undocumented because you shouldn't need them unless you're building something on top of domains explicitly
00:07 < othiym23> there are few situations in which module maintainers should need to add domain support themselves
00:07 < othiym23> generally it's best handled by app developers, because the goal is to get enough information for you to act on and then shut down the service gracefully (which is something that's been discussed a bunch both on the mailing list and on GitHub issues)
00:08 < othiym23> the edge cases are connection pools, where there are going to be EventEmitters that are long-lived and associated with more than one connection
00:08 < othiym23> and given the way felixge's MySQL driver works, it's kind of an edge case
00:09 < othiym23> if you were gonna mash it up with, say, generic-pool, you'd want to make sure that you incorporated domain support to your connection checkout implementation, but it maybe doesn't need to be in node-mysql itself
00:10 < listochkin> othiym23: thanks a lot! That clear things up for me
00:11 < othiym23> you're welcome!
00:12 < ChrisPartridge> yeah, good stuff othiym23
00:18 < garthk> Huh. Riak, maybe.
00:18 <@Nexxy> did somebody say Riak?
00:18 < garthk> Yes, Nexxy, somebody did just say Riak.
00:19 <@Nexxy> DID SOMEBODY SAY RIAK!?
00:19 < Guest15714> Lol
00:19 <@mbalho>                                           Nuclear Launch Detected
00:20 <@Nexxy> DEFCON 5 ENGAGE
00:20 < garthk> I've got to store tens of millions of ~10-30MB JSON arrays. Seems I can either code my way around LevelDB or raw filesystems at massive scale, or deploy this Riak thingy and just HTTP POST things. 
00:20 < garthk> That said: why the allergy? 
00:20 <@Nexxy> oh wait
00:20 <@Nexxy> DEFCON 1 ENGAGE
00:20 < Lorentz> uh, defcon 5 means it's peaceful
00:20 <@Nexxy> yeah yeah
00:20 <@Nexxy> lol
00:21 <@mbalho> lol
00:21 <@mbalho> defcon means script kiddies
00:21 < Mortchek> It was a friendly nuclear missile
00:21 < chilts> HTTP POST ALL THE THINGS!
00:21 < Mortchek> Just came over for a bit of tea
00:22 < chilts> including nuclear missiles
00:22 <@mbalho> kim jong un uses node
00:22 <@mbalho> greatleader.js on npm
00:22 < chilts> heh
00:22 <@mbalho> ooh someone start that twitter account
00:23 <@Nexxy> kim jong async
00:23 <@mbalho> "NUKE CALLBACK DIDNT FIRE, SHOULDA USED PROMISES"
00:23 < chilts> https://twitter.com/kimjongun <- protected!
00:26 < othiym23> mbalho: monadic promises or the shitty, old-fashioned, standards-compliant kind?
00:26 <@mbalho> hyperspace monads
00:26 <@mbalho> duh
00:26 < othiym23> dag
00:26 <@mbalho> haha
00:26 < othiym23> I don't even know what those are!
00:26 < othiym23> they must be really good
00:26 <@mbalho> hyperads for short
00:26 <@mbalho> theyre boss
00:26 < othiym23> I prefer "hypernads"
00:26 < othiym23> for self-evident reasons
00:26  * mbalho facepalm
00:27 < AshyIsMe> garthk: are you deploying on amazon ec2?
00:27 < AshyIsMe> riak looks pretty interesting
00:27 < AshyIsMe> especially if you can scale up nodes nice and easy
00:27 < garthk> AshyIsMe: nope. I have an internal VM stack and plenty of fast storage.
00:27 < CoverSlide> something wrong with riak?
00:27 < AshyIsMe> ooh and it's written in erlang, nice
00:28 < AshyIsMe> garthk: ah yeap, nice
00:29 < garthk> Nexxy: so, anything actually wrong with Riak?
00:29 < othiym23> the ultimate summary of Riak: http://browsertoolkit.com/fault-tolerance.png
00:29 < othiym23> (note: big fan of Riak here)
00:30 < GOMADWarrior> how to make a game?
00:30 < GOMADWarrior> multiplayer
00:30 < AshyIsMe> haha
00:30 < GOMADWarrior> by browser
00:31 < CoverSlide> you make a kickstarter and wait for the money to roll in, and then do nothing with it
00:31 < CoverSlide> that's how most games are made nowadays
00:31 < othiym23> somebody's clearly bitter about Star Command
00:31 < garthk> Suspecting Riak is only available for precise64. :/
00:32 < GOMADWarrior> I mean, can I have a main loop with node.js?
00:32 < othiym23> garthk: http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.0/tutorials/installation/Installing-on-Debian-and-Ubuntu/
00:32 < othiym23> support for 1[0-2].04, just not from universe
00:33 < Havvy> GOMADWarrior: Yes, but you shouldn't need one.
00:33 < Havvy> At least on the server side.
00:33 < CoverSlide> you shouldn't have a main loop in node
00:33 < garthk> othiym23: I'm following those instructions. /var/lib/apt/lists/apt.basho.com_dists_precise_main_binary-i386_Packages is empty.
00:34 < othiym23> hmmm
00:34 < othiym23> garthk: 32-bit?
00:34 < GOMADWarrior> but what if I want to update the physics and things
00:35 < CoverSlide> you have a function that gets called at some interval
00:35 < garthk> othiym23: yep. Downloading a precise64 vbox now.
00:35 < othiym23> garthk: yeah, looks like you have to build 32-bit from source :/
00:35 < ChrisPartridge> GOMADWarrior: search for "game" on npm and have a look through the source of some/all (if you're brave) modules
00:35 < Havvy> Does Node have a requestAnimationFrame() like thing?
00:36 < garthk> othiym23: bugger that for a game of soldiers. Practicing with the homebrew install while I wait.
00:36 < GOMADWarrior> CoverSlide, so isn't that a main loop?
00:36 < CoverSlide> no
00:37 < GOMADWarrior> yes it is
00:37 < othiym23> Havvy: about the closest you're going to get is process.nextTick(), which is like a general way of asynchronously doing work -- no DOM stuff exists by default in Node-land
00:37 < CoverSlide> the word "loop" has a special meaning when it comes to 'puters
00:37 < garthk> othiym23: OTOH, if I install from source I can use rebar to put together build packages to deploy to my servers. I'm attracted to that.
00:38 < sorensen> hey, you guys checked out https://www.hackerrank.com/?
00:38 < othiym23> garthk: the build process doesn't look that scary
00:38 < CoverSlide> <3 rebar
00:39 < Havvy> othiym23: Yeah. I know it doesn't have DOM stuff by default. Thus the word 'like'.
00:39 < sorensen> no
00:39 < sorensen> the anser is no
00:39 < othiym23> Havvy: welp, process.nextTick() is your jawn, then, or setImmediate() in 0.10+
00:39 < CoverSlide> jawn?
00:40 < sorensen> Havvy: i think really you should try to switch context away from the browser and think of JS more like python or ruby
00:40 < othiym23> CoverSlide: definition 1 of http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jawn
00:40 < sorensen> only... evented like erlang
00:41 < Havvy> sorensen: I think of Node's model as a similar one to Erlang's.
00:41 < sorensen> i'm speaking a bit out of my ass on erlang, i have yet to learn it
00:41 < sorensen> :D
00:41 < ChrisPartridge> garthk: do you have some sort of generic benchmark you are running against the different db's?
00:41 < ChrisPartridge> are you just streaming this JSON data out?
00:41 < sorensen> node.js is probably the best way to learn JS imho
00:41 < othiym23> Node's totally like Erlang, if you throw out the threads, the Actor model, the syntax, the purity, and OTP
00:42 < othiym23> otherwise they're exactly the same
00:42 < Havvy> sorensen: Then go read Learn You Some Erlang
00:42 < sorensen> Havvy: its next after Lua
00:42 < Havvy> You know JS. Ergo you know Lua.
00:42 < sorensen> i know the gist
00:42 < sorensen> not the syntax
00:42 < Havvy> Syntax is superficial.
00:42 < sorensen> thats like saying you know python ergo you know ruby
00:43 < CoverSlide> sorensen: that's actually fairly accurate
00:43 < sorensen> so i've been told ;)
00:43 < sorensen> but i know python and dont know ruby
00:44 < sorensen> so i think a more accurate statement is... if you know python, you can learn ruby easily
00:44 < CoverSlide> if you were given something that required you to know ruby, you'd be up and running in a couple days
00:44 < garthk> ChrisPartridge: I'd prefer to quickly choose something that'll let me get this store up and running quickly so I can get back to concentrating on my application. I'm running speed tests just to check whether something is within cooee of useful. I'm starting from the simplest-to-use things and working out from there. :)
00:44 < sorensen> CoverSlide: i agree, but every language has its differences and i think most coders would never assume that they know something without ever doing it
00:45 < sorensen> i get the idea of the analogy
00:45 < sorensen> but really its all silly talk
00:45 < sorensen> Lua is a bitch
00:46 < sorensen> dam tables
00:46 < garthk> Speaking of Erlang: Rust is fascinating. Lots of the fun of Erlang, but with a comfortable procedural/OOP façade to help you convince the rest of the team you should be allowed to play with it.
00:46 < sorensen> wtf{#wtf + 1] = 'wtf?'
00:46 < garthk> Also, tasklets and libuv back-end. 
00:46 < sorensen> garthk: wanting to learn erlang soon, any suggestions where to get started?
00:47 < sorensen> nothing serious mind yoi
00:47 < garthk> sorensen: nope. I read a few books, loved the ideas, felt clever for a bit, and forgot the lot because I couldn't work on something to apply it.
00:47 < sorensen> hmmm
00:47 < sorensen> i've been using hackerrank.com to learn new languages
00:47 < CoverSlide> yes, the best way to learn is to do it
00:47 < garthk> If Rust had something I could use in a similar fashion to Node's streams-of-objects-with-backpressure, I'd consider doing this app in Rust. 
00:47 < sorensen> since it gives you problems
00:47 < CoverSlide> try spoj.pl
00:47 < chapel> shut up sorensen, you lie!
00:48 < sorensen> I DO NOT!
00:48 < chapel> you do!
00:48 < CoverSlide> err www.spoj.com
00:48 < sorensen> maybe
00:48 < chapel> nodewar.com
00:48 < CoverSlide> hm, no more pollocks
00:48 < sorensen> chapel: you dont even know me
00:48 < sorensen> ;)
00:48 < chapel> sorensen: I know you play dubstep really loud :P
00:48 < sorensen> the dam house shakes
00:48 < chapel> coming to hb sunday?
00:49 < chapel> lazy bastard
00:49 < sorensen> i think so
00:49 < sorensen> i am lazy
00:49 < sorensen> i drink a lot sat's
00:49 < sorensen> sunday morning hard
00:49 < chapel> so am I, but now that I live 2 blocks away, hard to have an excuse
00:49 < sorensen> where did you go?
00:49 < chapel> we live on 57th now
00:49 < chapel> regal and 57th
00:49 < sorensen> since when!?
00:49 < chapel> since about a month ago
00:50 < sorensen> well.. shit
00:50 < sorensen> i'll beer there
00:50 < chapel> though, if I get a job, I'll probably be moving again
00:50 < chapel> should say when I get a job
00:50 < garthk> Found a way to build the Riak dev node cluster on OSX when using the homebrew package: http://ottopoellath.github.io/blog/2012/04/08/running-a-three-node-riak-cluster-using-a-homebrew-installation/
00:51 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.10 * b0de1e4 : stream: Fix unshift() race conditions  Fix #5272  The consumption of a re - http://git.io/D6qzLw
00:52 < garthk> Crap. Spoke too soon: Failed to open arguments file "./data/ssl_distribution.args_file": No such file or directory
00:53 < sorensen> idk why, but i hate homebrew
00:59 < s5fs> sorensen: but you love moonshine!
01:00 < sorensen> not as much as jim tom
01:01 < avoidwork> question, why would i receive dupe messages when clustering and sending a high volume of messages? worker > master is always unique messages, but master > target worker receives dupe messages, about 1400 in 13000 ... seems to happen in a spread across the volume of msgs, e.g. last measured first occurs was in msg 713 of 13311
01:01 < avoidwork> i'm always sending to the same target worker
01:11 < GOMADWarrior> my code is taking forever to pass judgebot
01:16 < sorensen> GOMADWarrior: i think they have pretty high load
01:20 < unsafe> how do I get the reason phrase out of a response?
01:20 < ningu> unsafe: huh?
01:21 < ningu> the "reason phrase"?
01:21 < unsafe> yeah, eg the "ok" in "200 ok"
01:21 < ningu> oh
01:21 < ningu> hmm
01:21 < ningu> I know there's res.statusCode
01:21 < ningu> you could just console.log(res), I can't remember
01:21 < unsafe> yeah, you'd think, but it's so dense I cant seem to find it
01:22 < ningu> oh, I bet it's in res.headers.status
01:22 < garthk> Cackling. The RIAK GET/PUT API is just what the doctor ordered, and it swallowed my 8MB document without complaint. Getting a bigger one…
01:23 < unsafe> I'll try that, thanks
01:24 < sorensen> i'm curious
01:24 < sorensen> will there ever be a django for node.js?
01:24 < ningu> what exactly is "a django"? :)
01:24 < sorensen> the concept of large projects seems to be very against the grain for node
01:24 < ningu> there's meteor and whatnot :)
01:24 < ningu> oh, right
01:25 < garthk> sorensen: I'm not sure. I love Django, but it's a little like Rails — it's optimised for CRUD apps working from a database.
01:25 < sorensen> of course
01:25 < ningu> I wonder if folks would say, no, don't use node for that stuff
01:25 < sorensen> well, people are,
01:25 < ningu> I love node though... it makes me sad to think I have to use ruby or python :) not that I hate either
01:26 < ningu> but some of the stuff node lets you do is so hard to do with them
01:26 < sorensen> i worry about using node quite a bit
01:26 < ningu> and vice versa I guess
01:26 < garthk> ningu: let's say you're working with cheap developers, and all you need is CRUD. Of bloody COURSE you'd steer them to something that didn't break their fresh-from-College heads with a completely different programming paradigm to the basic OOP/iterative model they've been trained in.
01:26 < sorensen> i wonder if its better to build the app with python/ruby and just have node services in the backround
01:27 < sorensen> garthk: thats pretty obscure
01:27 < sorensen> happens in every language
01:27 < ningu> garthk: I'm not talking about from a team or hiring standpoint. purely talking about whether from some measurable metric django is 'better'
01:27 < ningu> or whether you could justify saying, no, node is just as good if you do X Y Z
01:27 < sorensen> ningu: compared to node? yes
01:27 < GOMADWarrior> can I interrupt a function if it hasn't stopped after a certain time?
01:28 < garthk> sorensen: yeah, that's the context in which I was introduced to Node. Someone had a basic app running on a conventional, eaay-to-hire-for stack. It couldn't deal with one realtime data distribution problem, so they deployed Node adjacent to it and had Node do just the bit it was designed for.
01:28 < sorensen> last project i did was a genetic analysis tool, node was not the right tool for the job
01:28 < tjfontaine> GOMADWarrior: you want a child process
01:28 < GOMADWarrior> yes
01:28 < GOMADWarrior> threads?
01:28 < sorensen> garthk: we used it as a service with rabbitMQ and it was perfect
01:28 < sorensen> when it comes to having it be the entire app.... not convinced
01:29 < garthk> ningu: sorry, mate; I've been around paid-for teams for too long. Ability to hire talent, and its cost, are definitely metrics to consider in "better".
01:29 < sorensen> garthk: agreed
01:29 < sorensen> hiring is a bitch
01:29 < ningu> garthk: ok but those aren't the metrics *I* am interested in since it isn't relevant to me at all
01:29 < tjfontaine> GOMADWarrior: there's not a way in core at the moment to do so, the easiest way is with http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_child_process
01:29 < garthk> Well, then, you're a special snowflake, aren't you? :)
01:29 < ningu> haha
01:29 < sorensen> hehe
01:30 < ningu> I have a CRUDish app I've written in node. it's not so bad really.
01:30 < sorensen> its very much something to consider
01:30 < sorensen> most every *app* deals with crud
01:30 < ningu> I'm sure various stuff would be better in django
01:30 < garthk> If you only want to work with absolute bleeding-from-the-ears insanely brilliant people, of course, you find excuses to build with an obscure or difficult framework. It filters out the morons. 
01:30 < tjfontaine> GOMADWarrior: there is some discussion on the concept https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/4115
01:30 < sorensen> garthk: doesnt make much sense
01:31 < sorensen> talent is talent
01:31 < ningu> I've been thinking lately quite seriously about whether ORMs are "worth it" and I say this as someone who spent a good portion of time improving and maintaining a very nice ORM
01:31 < sorensen> ningu: the answer is yes :D
01:32 < sorensen> the reality for me i feel is that you get 90% productivty increase using ORMs
01:32 < sorensen> something running slow? then break out of the box and optimize when needed
01:32 < ningu> I've been using an SQL generator, which solves much of the issue. hand-writing SQL is kind of crazy for most cases.
01:32 < sorensen> which without the ORM you would have had to do anyways
01:32 < sorensen> theres really no loss
01:33 <@Nexxy> except for the time spent figuring out WTF is wrong with your broken ORM
01:33 < timw255> Which is more suitable for production, multiple processes behind a load balancer or using cluster? I'm looking for information on the multi-process method but there is a comment in every thread "Why aren't you using cluster?" lol
01:33 < sorensen> i'm a bit sad the node community seems to hate SQL
01:33 <@Nexxy> and why it isn't doing what you think it should be doing
01:33 < sorensen> Nexxy: well... thats with ANYTHING you use as a dependency
01:33 < ChrisPartridge> Nexxy: but that's why we write tests? :P
01:33 < ningu> sorensen: I do not hate SQL.
01:33 < sorensen> ningu: i feel its a common node.js trait
01:33 < ningu> sorensen: I was not advocating not using relational databases. I'm wondering *how* best to use them.
01:33 < sorensen> i may be wrong
01:33 < sorensen> i wanst talking about you ;)
01:33 < ningu> you aren't wrong, I'm just distinguishing my special snowflakeness ;)
01:34 < sorensen> matha. fuckan. snow. flakes.
01:34 < ningu> I am coming to the view that a lot of the logic I might use an ORM for should be implemented with triggers and views
01:34 < garthk> Oh, man. So with you there, ningu. I spent ages ranting about anaemic models and helping build a massive rich model with lots of behaviour… and now the juniors can't make any changes without cocking it up, and meanwhile I've shifted to writing tools that deal with streams of behaviour-less simple data chunks in a functional manner. Oops.,
01:34 < sorensen> if there was a mongoose for sql i would die of happiness
01:34 < ningu> sorensen: yeah it's a big lack.
01:35 < ningu> however you maybe should check out gesundheit, it's a nice SQL generator.
01:35 < sorensen> but node.js is very much nosql
01:35 < unsafe> sorensen: one of my coworkers has been working on something...
01:35 < sorensen> unsafe: would be very interested
01:35 < ningu> gesundheit can generate 99% of the queries I need
01:35 < ningu> which is saying something since I seem to have a knack for weird queries
01:35 < sorensen> its more about modeling
01:35 < unsafe> sorensen: it might not be quite what you're looking for, but let me grab the url
01:35 < sorensen> pure sql generation is just the first step ;)
01:36 < sorensen> i want User.load(id)
01:36 < unsafe> https://github.com/goodybag/mongo-sql
01:36 < sorensen> unsafe: you are correct, it is not
01:36 < sorensen> thanks for the link though
01:36 < ChrisPartridge> unsafe: i think he meant a decent ORM for sql, not sql for mongo
01:36 < unsafe> yeah, we've talked about orms
01:36 < sorensen> its not for mongo
01:36 < sorensen> it looks to be a mongo like thing
01:36 < unsafe> it's a sql generator that uses a mongo-like query description
01:37 < sorensen> but with mongo trying to do sql things its confusing
01:37 < sorensen> :P
01:37 < ningu> I believe that I can solve almost all of the things an ORM would solve for me by implementing the relevant triggers, constraints, and views in the database -- and then I don't have to worry about whether the ORM is failing or whether I am tied to the ORM
01:37 < sorensen> i feel that sql generators that you would use in a project need to be all encompasing
01:37 < unsafe> yeah, that may sink it in the long run, but the idea is to simplify querying. As for the ORM, we actually debate this
01:37 < ningu> however I *am* then tied to the database, I won't argue with you there.
01:38 < sorensen> ningu: ...
01:38 < unsafe> we're not sure we want an ORM since node-postgres hydrates objects correctly
01:38 < sorensen> thats.. short sighted?
01:38 < ningu> sorensen: how come?
01:38 < ningu> unsafe: yeah, and add hstore support and it's pretty awesome
01:38 < sorensen> your abstracing an ORM due to your ability to use triggers?
01:39 < sorensen> the reasoning doesnt make sense
01:39 < ningu> sorensen: it's a question of where to put the logic.
01:39 < sorensen> it always is ;)
01:39 < unsafe> ningu: yeah, JSON support is going to keep improving in postgres. We actually have another team member that's the author of node-postgres; he's going to add in correct parsing of the json type that postgres uses so that aggregates come out hydrated as well
01:39 < ningu> awesome
01:40 < ningu> unsafe: he didn't write node-postgres-hstore did he? cause that needs a fix...
01:40 < ningu> I should submit a PR
01:40 < unsafe> I dont think so
01:40 < ningu> it can't handle arrays of hstore, but it's an easy fix
01:40 < ningu> as long as you feed it the hstore array oid
01:41 < ningu> you might say the node community believes sql databases are for the oids
01:41 < unsafe> was that a pun?
01:41 < yogurt_truck> ew. ORMs...
01:41 < ningu> it was a new york accent/postgres pun
01:41 < sorensen> :\
01:41 < ningu> I specialize in obscure pun combinations
01:41 < sorensen> yogurt_truck: why?
01:41 < unsafe> niche market
01:42 < ningu> I love transactions. so I can't quit sql.
01:42 < ningu> besides I'm more in the "small data" world ;)
01:42 < sorensen> sql is just a language spec
01:42 < unsafe> postgres is really solid tech
01:42 < unsafe> obviously we built a lot on it
01:42 < sorensen> agreed
01:43 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: what are their benefits again?
01:43 < ChrisPartridge> <3 postgres
01:43 < unsafe> I'm playing a lot with redis right now, and I'm pretty in love with it too
01:43 < sorensen> yogurt_truck: have you never used an ORM?
01:43 < Agro> How would I check if a string begins with "FOO"?
01:43 < sorensen> or are we playing some type of game here
01:43 < ningu> oh, redis rocks, yes
01:43 < ningu> redis is just a different use case
01:43 < ChrisPartridge> Agro: regex?
01:43 < unsafe> Agro: string.indexOf('FOO') === 
01:43 < Agro> thanks
01:44 < unsafe> err
01:44 < unsafe> === 0
01:44 < Agro> yeah
01:44 < unsafe> ningu: yeah
01:44 < ningu> redis is so clean, it's really nice at what it does, and the auto-expire is also extremely convenient
01:44 < unsafe> I've got this server that's meant to only serve <100 users
01:44 < unsafe> yeah, not to mention the way you can do atomicity
01:44 < sorensen> redis is very nice, but would never use it as a DB
01:45 < unsafe> a lot of good atomic operations, and then lua scripts are effectively atomic because it's single-threaded
01:45 < ningu> I implemented a redis cache on BART on the way to work
01:45 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: yes I have use them.
01:45 < yogurt_truck> used*
01:45 < sorensen> love using it for personal things, and writing Lua scripts for it
01:45 < unsafe> sorensen: why wouldnt you use it as your db?
01:45 < sorensen> too much manual work for the sake of speed
01:45 < ningu> I wouldn't use redis as my db if my data were relational
01:45 < ningu> yeah
01:45 < unsafe> yeah
01:45 < sorensen> though really it depends on the problem
01:46 < unsafe> it's fitting this use-case pretty well so far. 
01:46 < unsafe> no relations, so yeah
01:46 < ningu> if I used redis for my relational data it would make a hash of everything
01:46 < sorensen> yeah
01:46 < unsafe> yeah, you just couldnt do the aggregation queries
01:46 < sorensen> but what about nested hashes?
01:46 < ningu> nested hashes don't make a good breakfast
01:47 < sorensen> unsafe: good point, what about aggregation?
01:47 < ningu> anyway it was a joke, I guess it was too obscure again :)
01:47 < sorensen> ningu: its possible with lua ;)
01:47 < ningu> hmm
01:47 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: and then quickly became counter-productive. so what are the benefits again?
01:47 < ningu> I've never looked at lua scripts in redis
01:47 < unsafe> sorensen: what do you mean?
01:47 < ningu> anyway I'm sticking with good old postgres for my current project
01:48 < sorensen> yogurt_truck: not to sound lazy, but id rather not get into a debate about your ideals against ORM's, i feel your questions is trying to draw me into an argument
01:48 < sorensen> which is probably valid
01:48 < sorensen> i would just rather not
01:48 < sorensen> unsafe: let me put a gist together
01:50 < ningu> sorensen: I am curious actually what you image the most important role of an ORM is
01:50 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: why would this be an argument? i don't _hate_ ORMs. they're ok for trivial projects. especially in languages with poor high level power abstraction-wise
01:50 < ningu> imagine*
01:50 < unsafe> I think ORMs historically existed to build queries and hydrate objects with the results
01:50 < sorensen> sorry, just felt like i was being drawn into an argument
01:50 < sorensen> had a few beers, so dont really want to be the fool
01:50 < unsafe> and like I was saying, node-postgres actually does the hydration for you
01:51 < sorensen> really i feel ORM's replace much of the manual work most people are going to do in finding/saving/updating any given object in any database
01:51 < yogurt_truck> the fact is for any project with complex schemas, or when dealing with existing databases, SQL is already the _best_ language for querying
01:51 < sorensen> ultimately saving time for the developer instead of doing everything manual
01:52 < unsafe> it is very good -- though datomic is giving it a run with datalog -- but constructing the queries can be a pain in code
01:52 < sorensen> there really is no _best_ thing for every project, it all depends on the project
01:52 < yogurt_truck> if you make simple queries then sure, have an abstraction that does User.save() for you might sound like a time saver. but as soon as you get a bit complex, the weaknesses and annoyances of an ORM appear immediately 
01:52 < sorensen> my latest app i've inherited has issues with looking up things from the DB by id or key or slug
01:53 < sorensen> has to be very specific
01:53 < sorensen> though i suppose it might be SQL specific to say an ORM would solve such issues
01:53 < sorensen> couchDB doesnt have such mechanics
01:53 < ningu> unsafe: when you say node-postgres already does hydrating do you mean returning rows as js objects with attributes for each column, and arrays as arrays etc.? or does it do more than that?
01:53 < unsafe> ningu: yeah, that's what I mean
01:53 < sorensen> i feel like i've been set back 10 years in my ability to write code and look up data
01:54 < sorensen> ningu: i kinda assume thats what hydrating means
01:54 < sorensen> i may be completely wrong
01:54 < sorensen> a lot of libs involving db's are lazy
01:54 < sorensen> so hydrating is an actual thing
01:54 < sorensen> :P
01:55 < sorensen> lazy in the sense they dont load anything unless required
01:55 < yogurt_truck> why say hydrating instead of just deserializing
01:55 < sorensen> because they are different things
01:55 < yogurt_truck> btw it's also often hard to take advantage if a DB's interesting features when one uses an ORM
01:55 < sorensen> depends on the ORM's target DB
01:56 < sorensen> mongoose does a pretty good job
01:56 < sorensen> and hey, whats to stop you from just using the db without it?
01:57 < sorensen> serialize/deserialize is a very get/set paradigm
01:57 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: how is hydrating not deserializing?
01:57 < unsafe> I actually agree with yogurt_truck about ORMs in the traditional sense
01:57 < sorensen> can be related to JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
01:57 < sorensen> there is nothing involved in those words that relates to the sense of an object
01:57 < sorensen> or OOP
01:58 < sorensen> your talking about simple things
01:58 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: yeah exactly, that's the point, any non-trivial project will then become a salad of ORM API + plain driver API calls.
01:58 < sorensen> and?
01:58 < unsafe> if you can easily build queries, easily hydrate or deserialize or whatever we call it, and easily drop back to pure SQL statements, you're pretty well set
01:58 < sorensen> you make points simply to make them?
01:58 < sorensen> please be constructive
01:58 < ningu> I recently ported an app from mongo to postgres and it was actually not that hard because of node-postgres's hydrate stuff
01:59 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: what do you mean "the sense of an object"?
01:59 < sorensen> not sure
01:59 < sorensen> serialization is get/set tbh
01:59 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: is "hydrating"? and how is "deserializing" not "related to the sense of an object"?
01:59 < sorensen> string to object, object to string
01:59 < sorensen> it doenst really have a higher goal
02:00 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: what do you mean string/object? serialization doesn't inherently have anything to do with strings at all
02:00 < sorensen> then you know the points your arguing
02:00 < sorensen> and you are doing so just to do it
02:00 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: what?
02:01 < sorensen> i'm fairly positive you are seeking an argument about things you know about
02:01 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: I'm asking you to back what you're saying and you're just answering "you are arguing"
02:01 < ningu> I would like to take this moment to recommend gesundheit and any-db to anyone using sql in node ;)
02:01 < sorensen> this is true
02:01 < ningu> any-db's transactions are really convenient
02:01 < sorensen> i will give you that they are related
02:02 < sorensen> hydrating and serialization are very much different though
02:02 < sorensen> hydration implies that you are filling an object with its data when required
02:02 < sorensen> a high level concept, the details do not matter much
02:03 < sorensen> serialization is the conversion of types
02:03 < sorensen> string -> object, object -> string
02:03 < sorensen> as just an example
02:03 < unsafe> I was probably mis-speaking by that definition, since node-postgres doesnt target an object
02:03 < sorensen> the thing you are really asking in a different sense, is why is a object.get method not the same as a db.load method
02:03 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: filling an object with data from where?
02:03 < sorensen> ;)
02:04 < ningu> from a yogurt truck, that's where most important data comes from
02:04 < sorensen> yogurt_truck: how about this: jee whiz man idk
02:04 < yogurt_truck> sorensen: you've described lazy evaluation and deserialization. hydration seems a useless concept.
02:04 < sorensen> then please explain it to me
02:05 < sorensen> i would like to hear your answers
02:05 < yogurt_truck> and if the hydration consists in bringing data from the DB to "an object", then that's deserialization, plain and simple
02:05 < sorensen> the questions are tiresome
02:05 < yogurt_truck> lazy val user = User.load(id)
02:06 < yogurt_truck> there. you have a lazily deserialized user object. (in Scala) :D
02:06 < Foxhoundz> I included underscore.string.js for a node script
02:07 < Foxhoundz> but for some reason, calling functions from underscore.string still  throws TypeErrors 
02:07 < faceleg|work> git status
02:07 < faceleg|work> urgh
02:07 < Foxhoundz> like it isn't loaded or something
02:08 < Foxhoundz> I checked npm and it shows it as being installed
02:08 < Foxhoundz> I also tried manually downloading underscore.string.js and including it 
02:10 < ningu> Foxhoundz: pastebin your code or we won't be able to say much
02:12 < Foxhoundz> http://pastie.org/private/jlpxhsqsr0pwffcfwiplq
02:12 < Foxhoundz> the offending line is 61
02:13 < Foxhoundz> where the _() function is first called
02:14 < ChrisPartridge> Foxhoundz: _.stripTags(stringHere);
02:14 < ningu> shouldn't that be _.stripTags(answer)?
02:15 < Foxhoundz> It...
02:15 < Foxhoundz> it can't be..
02:15 < ningu> why not?
02:15 < garthk> Ooh! packages.json can point to a tar ball!
02:15 < garthk> That helps me out a great deal.
02:16 < ningu> what does it do with it?
02:16 < ChrisPartridge> come on Foxhoundz, read the docs :)
02:16 < Foxhoundz> Aha!
02:16 < Foxhoundz> It worked
02:16 < Foxhoundz> thank you
02:16 < Foxhoundz> ChrisPartridge: this is my first day with underscore and node.js
02:16 < Foxhoundz> I'm still getting into the groove
02:17 < ChrisPartridge> :)
02:25 < Foxhoundz> ChrisPartridge: by the way, looking at my code, am I doing something that breaks the coding guidelines of node.js?
02:27 < ChrisPartridge> Foxhoundz: apart from dealing with the devil (XML), it looks good :)
02:28 < ChrisPartridge> Foxhoundz: actually, inside the foxy callback, you might want to return inside the if(!result) block, otherwise its going to continue down
02:53 < faceleg|work> is there a Math function that converts any number into a negative?
02:53 < faceleg|work> like shorthand for-1 * Math.abs(a number)
02:53 < faceleg|work> << -1 * Math.abs(1)
02:53 < faceleg|work> >> -1 * Math.abs(1)
02:54 < purr> faceleg|work: (number) -1
02:54 < faceleg|work> >> -1 * Math.abs(-1)
02:54 < purr> faceleg|work: (number) -1
02:54 < garthk> Anyone using LevelDB on NFS? 
03:20 < myndzi> FATAL ERROR: v8::Context::New() V8 is no longer usable
03:20 < myndzi> any idea what that's about?
03:30 < ningu> hrm... is there an easy way in node to print out a stack trace at a particular point?
03:30 < ningu> ah, console.trace()
03:31 < ChrisPartridge> myndzi: during build?
03:33 < myndzi> no
03:33 < myndzi> just trying to run a node app
03:34 < ningu> hrm... async.each seems to be calling its final callback more than once :(
03:34 < ningu> I must be missing something, another set of eyes could help: http://hastebin.com/vayipivupo.coffee
03:34 < ningu> the callback on line 46 is being called twice.
03:34 < ChrisPartridge> myndzi: whats your `ulimit -v` output?
03:35 < ChrisPartridge> ningu: has to be your code, surely!
03:35 < ningu> the relevant async.each I just mentioned is on line 118.
03:35 < ningu> ChrisPartridge: probably :)
03:35 < myndzi> i'll put it this way, i was restarting an app that's been running for months
03:35 < ningu> and note the setImmediate on line 91
03:35 < myndzi> i just don't know what the error means
03:35 < ningu> erm
03:35 < myndzi> i wound up rebooting the system, it just came up
03:35 < ningu> line 208, I mean
03:36 < ningu> I could just once() the callback but... really I don't see how it's being called twice at all
03:36 < ningu> might use node-inspector
03:36 < ningu> but that's a pain for this stuff
03:36 < chapel> ningu: well line 27 you don't return error(err)
03:36 < chapel> though nvm
03:36 < ningu> yeah but it's an if/else
03:36 < chapel> if/else
03:42 < chapel> what db are you using?
03:44 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.10 * 8ee4300 : build: Typo in tools/msvs/msi/product.wxs - http://git.io/czPPSw
03:50 < ningu> chapel: postgres
03:50 < ningu> but the issue isn't really at the postgres end as far as I can tell
03:50 < ningu> it seems to be async calling the end callback more than once which is really weird
03:50 < chapel> could db.begin be firing twice?
03:50 < ningu> hrm
03:50 < ningu> I don't think so but will check
03:51 < ningu> nope only once
03:51 < chapel> hmm
03:52 < chapel> how are you sure?
03:52 < chapel> since if its async, it would call twice as well
03:52 < ningu> chapel: I put a console.log in
03:52 < ningu> to say "begin" when it begins
03:53 < ningu> that's how I know anything is being called twice
03:54 < ChrisPartridge> moar console.log's ningu :)
03:55 < ningu> haha
03:55 < ningu> where?
03:55 < ChrisPartridge> everywhere
03:55 < ningu> hehe
03:56 < ruff> i got a bitcoin today
03:56 < ruff> does this mean i can quit my job?
03:56 < ningu> oh... duh
03:56 < ningu> I just realized what it is
03:57 < ningu> in adsourceDirectory it's reading several files and calling async.each several times
03:57 < ChrisPartridge> ruff: whats the value of a bitcoin these days?
03:57 < ChrisPartridge> ningu: hah!
03:57 < ningu> down to $55 last I heard
03:58 < chapel> you're codes a mess to my eyes (I don't like doing super nested functions called in many different areas
03:58 < chapel> ningu: not saying its bad though
03:58 < ningu> chapel: I wrote most of this when I was first learning node
03:58 < ningu> only cleaned it up slightly just now
03:58 < chapel> ah, yeah I get that
03:58 < ningu> how would you do it differently?
03:59 < chapel> reading my old code is hard
03:59 < ningu> the logic is fairly intricate
03:59 < chapel> well I like named functions and mimicking sync code flow (top to bottom)
04:00 < chapel> so doSomething(thenDoThis)\n\nfunction thenDoThis(err) { blah }
04:00 < ningu> yeah I often don't know what order to declare functions in
04:00 < ningu> there are conflicting needs
04:03 < ningu> and this is a one-off script so I didn't make several files
04:04 < innociv> $90
04:04 < s2013> is nodejs easy to pickup if you are familiar with js?
04:06 < ningu> s2013: pretty much I would say. you will still have to learn some new patterns
04:06 < ChrisPartridge> ningu: tbh, my one off scripts look much worse than that :p
04:06 < ningu> hehe
04:06 < s2013> oh ok. and i heard it doesnt work well on windows?
04:07 < ningu> whee it works now
04:07 < ChrisPartridge> works fine on windows
04:07 < ningu> s2013: that was a long time ago
04:07 < ChrisPartridge> s2013: just grab the MSI, and you're off and node'ing!
04:09 < syoutsey> hey guys, rookie question: when i'm using node.js with express, why does my jsonp callback take the form of 'callback_func && callback_func({json : data});'
04:09 < s2013> yeah i installed it. just looked at it for a bit but didnt go beyond it. im thinking of learning it. is express the most commonly used nodejs framework?
04:09 < syoutsey> i'm used to it just being pure json, 'callback_func({json : data});'
04:10 < ChrisPartridge> s2013: for building lean web apps, i'd say so
04:11 < ningu> syoutsey: looks like it's testing if there is a callback_func or not. if you know it will always exist you can eliminate that check.
04:12 < syoutsey> ningu: hmm, that seems to be what i get back regardless. how can i eliminate the check?
04:13 < syoutsey> i'm using this: http://expressjs.com/api.html#res.jsonp
04:14 < s2013> cool. thanks
04:15 < ningu> syoutsey: I don't really understand what you mean. if you want to eliminate the check just take it out of your code.
04:18 < syoutsey> ningu: that's what the jsonp is sending back to the client, regardless. i'm loading in the jsonp from a <script> tag and it's including that first check. so i'd like to prevent the server from sending it, rather than the client from parsing it
04:18 < syoutsey> ningu: i hope that makes more sense :-)
04:18 < ningu> oh I see.
04:20 < ningu> syoutsey: see https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/lib/response.js
04:20 < ningu> you can file an issue or ask tj about it
04:20 < ningu> I assume it's there for a reason
04:20 < ningu> line 239
04:21 < syoutsey> gotcha, thank you for the lead!
04:40 < deoxxa> i'm playing with the idea of applying templates to streams
04:41 < deoxxa> a lot of template systems have some kind of {% for item in list %}...{% endfor %} structure
04:41 < deoxxa> i'm thinking about a {% stream item from readableStream %}...{% endstream %}
04:41 < deoxxa> with all the cool implications that brings along
04:41 < deoxxa> does this sound crazy?
04:42 < deoxxa> like, it's definitely crazy, i know that much, but does it sound useful to anyone other than me?
04:43 < chilts> deoxxa: what happens if you have other 'from readableStream' in your template, will it all still work?
04:43 < chilts> and other loops, ifs and buts :)
04:43 < deoxxa> yeah, i've got a bit of a plan mapped out for that
04:44 < deoxxa> and i intend for that to work fine
04:44 < chilts> I guess it's just like rendering the template async, which should be fine I guess
04:44 < deoxxa> yeah
04:44 < deoxxa> it makes the generated code so much more complex though
04:44 < deoxxa> which kind of blows
04:44 < chilts> just a case of waiting for all streams to end and all asyncs to come back
04:44 < chilts> yeah
04:44 < chilts> this using ginger?
04:45 < deoxxa> yeah, working on a kind of ginger 2.0
04:45 < deoxxa> complete rewrite
04:45 < deoxxa> same syntax etc, but better implementation
04:45 < chilts> oh ... why? needed or just fun?
04:45 < chilts> ok
04:45 < deoxxa> it's hard to maintain the current one
04:45 < deoxxa> there's not a lot of separation
04:47 < ChrisPartridge> deoxxa: i'd certainly give it a shot, doesn't sound *that* crazy
04:49 < deoxxa> ChrisPartridge: oh no, it's totally crazy
04:49 < deoxxa> ChrisPartridge: but it's a good kind of crazy
04:49 < ningu> I dunno, templates *are* rendered in a basically linear order, it sounds doable
04:49 < ningu> but tricky
04:49 < hackedy> haha I'm going through old issues in joyent/node and it's spooky. it's like a graveyard out here.
04:50 < deoxxa> lol
04:53 < ningu> hackedy: eh?
04:54 < hackedy> ningu: check out https://github.com/joyent/node/issues?direction=asc&page=1&sort=comments&state=open
04:54 < hackedy> open issues sorted by least commented
04:54 < hackedy> i suppose least recently updated is more ghostly
04:54 < hackedy> ghostlier
04:56 < ningu> hehe
04:56 < ningu> 512 open issues is quite a few
04:56 < ningu> I suppose not for a large project
04:56 < hackedy> rails has 462
04:58 < perlitch> so i was deciding between two classes for performing simple arithmetic with big numbers in js (> 32 bit)… one was BigNumber (5kb minified) and the other was BigInteger (22kb). the latter seemed a bit like overkill to me and more cumbersome to use…until i made this very simple jsperf: http://jsperf.com/bignumber-v-jsbn2. somebody please tell me if my setup or test suite is misleading or ill-conceived because these results are just ri
04:58 <@mbalho> mikolalysenko: o/
05:06 < myndzi> looks like an algorithmic advantage
05:06 < myndzi> but you might try with more varied data
05:16 < mikolalysenko> mbalho: hi
05:16 <@mbalho> mikolalysenko: there was a juicy numeric perf question
05:17 <@mbalho> mikolalysenko: i cast summon math wizard level 5
05:17 < Lucas__> hey!
05:17 < mikolalysenko> mbalho: I can answer this without even reading it to carefully
05:18 < mikolalysenko> grep through the code, you will find that BigNumber uses JS's with() all over the place
05:18 < mikolalysenko> which completely kills its performance
05:18 < mikolalysenko> case closed
05:18 < Lucas__> I have made a script that automatically translated a website, using i18n. It automatically translates an html without need to use _() or gettext functions, or any templating system. Should i upload it as free software for other people? or will nobody care?
05:18 < mikolalysenko> in fact the whole thing is defined in a giant with() block
05:20 < ChrisPartridge> Lucas__: there was someone here last week, trying to do exactly that
05:21 < Lucas__> ChrisPartridge, well i already did it. maybe it was just myself? I was here trying to do this many weeks ago
05:21 < ningu> agu10^: yes I remember you quite well hehe
05:21 < ningu> it was 2-3 weeks ago
05:22 < ningu> you should certainly upload it
05:22 < ningu> what did you end up using? did you solve the performance issues?
05:23 < ChrisPartridge> agu10^: yeah, i think it was
05:23 < agu10^> ningu, i used cheetah instead of jQuery and jsdom, and i used node_i18n i think. Nothing else :)
05:24 < agu10^> there are no performance issues as far as i've noticed.
05:24 < ningu> cheetah or cheerio?
05:24 < agu10^> because i18n caches the translation
05:24 < agu10^> hmm let me see
05:24 < ningu> cheerio is quite nice
05:24 < agu10^> yeah i meant cheerio
05:24 < ningu> not sure about its speed for what you were doing but if it works, it works
05:25 < agu10^> I think i want to code ALL my websites using something like cheerio instead of the old-style html patching
05:25 < ningu> well you can give it a try
05:25 < agu10^> ningu, it responds fast, but i don't have a heavy loaded website so i wouldn't know if it's good enough for others
05:25 < ningu> what hooks do you put in the html for it to modify?
05:26 < ningu> do you set attributes or what?
05:26 < agu10^> i traverse the dom and find all plain text elements, and translate them
05:26 < agu10^> no attributes
06:01 < leichtgewicht> Small question about the topic: Is it meant sarcastic ?
06:01 < sambarino> yes :)
06:01 < deoxxa> SAMARINOOOOO
06:01 < deoxxa> good choice sir
06:01 < sambarino> :)
06:01 < geNAZt> hi
06:02 < sambarino> don't mix reds with the whites!
06:02 < geNAZt> does someone work with the MVP pattern ? or single page webapps ?
06:02 < geNAZt> i would like to here what the seo does with it
06:02 < agu10^> MVP sux
06:02 < agu10^> geNAZt, I make single page sites
06:02 < agu10^> http://potentialstudio.com
06:02 < geNAZt> lol
06:02 < geNAZt> MVP sucks but you make single page webapps
06:02 < agu10^> heheh
06:02 < geNAZt> ..... yeah
06:03 < geNAZt> its only the question how do you get into the seo thing ?
06:03 < agu10^> i use MVC. not sure what the difference is
06:03 < geNAZt> cause crawler doesnt execute js
06:03 < geNAZt> MVC => Server Routing, Templating
06:03 < agu10^> my page has all the html in it
06:03 < geNAZt> MVP => Model + View => Server, Templating and Routing => BRowser
06:04 < agu10^> i don't need to run js to change it
06:04 < geNAZt> so its not single paged
06:04 < geNAZt> :D
06:04 < agu10^> yes it is
06:04 < agu10^> look at it
06:04 < agu10^> http://potentialstudio.com
06:04 < agu10^> i send ALL the html, then hide it with javascript
06:04 < leichtgewicht> I am thinking about a Node.js based out-of-the-box CMS similar to drupal... is there a comparable thing or a group thinking about it?
06:04 < geNAZt> well ok
06:05 < ChrisPartridge> geNAZt: you could look at airbnb's solution, https://github.com/airbnb/rendr
06:06 < leichtgewicht> agu10^: A MVC is based on the premise that the data can change(loaded).
06:06 < agu10^> so?
06:06 < leichtgewicht> If you load all the data at start ... nothing change.s
06:06 < geNAZt> the general question is how to seo a mvp pattern driven site
06:06 < ElectricMaxxx> good morning everybody
06:06 < agu10^> leichtgewicht, yes, you change it with javascript after loading the initial one
06:07 < agu10^> leichtgewicht, those are not mutually exclusive
06:07 < leichtgewicht> Yeah. I jumped to stiff in the discussion.
06:07 < agu10^> well i don't understand what the issue is
06:07 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: CMS?
06:08 < agu10^> SEO works fine with single page webs
06:08 < leichtgewicht> I usually prepare the html structure as if it needed work without javascript.
06:08 < geNAZt> well the html output from mvp comes out of the browser
06:08 < geNAZt> so i need to render it in the browser to display it
06:08 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: Content Management System?
06:08 < NuZZ> how is this racking ur brain?
06:08 < agu10^> geNAZt, ok, do it
06:08 < geNAZt> but since a crawler doesnt execute js it cant render
06:08 < NuZZ> it should be no different than serverside
06:09 < leichtgewicht> So the crawler likes the page.
06:09 < agu10^> not really
06:09 < standoo1> standoo1: how would it be different in nodejs?
06:09 < agu10^> geNAZt, why would you not send the html to the crawler?
06:09 < geNAZt> because i dont have a templating engine on the server
06:09 < agu10^> well, i guess that's your issue
06:09 < geNAZt> no its not an issue
06:09 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: I am not sure what your question is.
06:10 < agu10^> single-page web doesn't mean you don't need serverside code
06:10 < standoo1> standoo1: why make it in nodejs when you have drupal?
06:10 < geNAZt> well i dont say i need single page
06:10 < agu10^> you don't need it if you constrain yourself to the consequences
06:10 < geNAZt> i make mvp or have a mvp software
06:10 < geNAZt> and i need to add a seo for it
06:10 < agu10^> ok
06:11 < agu10^> then you need to use server side code i think
06:11 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: Well, same could be said about any solution ever ... why nodejs?
06:11 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: Assembler does all the things JavaScript can do ;)
06:11 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: haha true
06:11 < agu10^> leichtgewicht, except run on a browser
06:12 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: i think its a good idea actually
06:12 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: haven't found a decent CMS in nodejs yet
06:12 < sambarino> yeah
06:12 < leichtgewicht> agu10^: true, you'd need to write a browser in assembler first ;)
06:12 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: i am very keen to test it out once you make it
06:12 < agu10^> standoo1, i think node.js is not particularly well suited for a big web like a CMS
06:13 < agu10^> leichtgewicht, no nyou don't
06:13 < standoo1> agu10^: perhaps the CMS needs to be a few node.js apps
06:13 < agu10^> you can write it in whatever you want
06:13 < standoo1> agu10^: maybe a different design than current CMS
06:13 < agu10^> standoo1, one can do fine, but i don't think it's ready for that yet.
06:13 < agu10^> i'd suggest asp.net or ruby or java or python
06:14 < leichtgewicht> for a cms?
06:14 < geNAZt> looool
06:14 < agu10^> yes
06:14 < sambarino> i think you could do it
06:14 < leichtgewicht> why shouldn't nodejs be ready?
06:14 < sambarino> using templates
06:14 < standoo1> agu10^: a CMS could be simple
06:14 < agu10^> running CMS on those languages instead of nodejs i'd say
06:14 < geNAZt> you can use any language you like for it
06:14 < agu10^> yes, but usually isn't standoo1 
06:14 < sambarino> personally i think nodejs is a good fit for cms
06:14 < agu10^> ok
06:14 < standoo1> well, we'll see when someone makes one
06:15 < leichtgewicht> I think nodejs _could_ be a good fit
06:15 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: you going to make one?
06:15 < sambarino> with great power comes great responsibility
06:15 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: A CMS is not to be made by one person.
06:15 < sambarino> the suitability of nodejs for cms apps rests in your hands leichtgewicht
06:15 < standoo1> standoo1: you can start it
06:16 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: That's why I was wondering if there are already efforts in this area ;)
06:16 < agu10^> it doesn't matter if it's possible to do
06:16 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: not to my knowlege
06:16 < agu10^> it matters that there's no good CMS according to standoo1 
06:16 < standoo1> agu10^: i think its about execution
06:17 < sambarino> http://calip.so/
06:17 < leichtgewicht> http://nodize.com/ http://calip.so/ https://github.com/creationix/wheat
06:17 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: think you can do a better job?
06:18 < sambarino> lol
06:18 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: given time and opporunity ...
06:18 < sambarino> there's even http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3684743/cms-based-on-nodejs
06:18 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: you can give yourself that
06:18 < leichtgewicht> standoo1: New born son, wife and 60hour job
06:19 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: hmmm, you can't really cut down on your son and wife
06:19 < standoo1> leichtgewicht: cut down on your job?
06:19 < leichtgewicht> and they want the money ... ;)
06:19 < sambarino> so there's about 11 nodejs cms attempts there, find the best one and make it better :)
06:20 < agu10^> or don't
06:20 < sambarino> yes, or don't
06:20 < sambarino> wait until node.js is more like .net
06:21 < standoo1> sambarino: will it be?
06:21 < agu10^> hey, i'm trying to make my automatic web translation script open source, but i need to make it a useful templating system or plugin for node. what should i do?
06:21 < sambarino> we can only dream
06:21 < agu10^> currently i just read the html and run my script on it
06:21 < agu10^> how do i intercept all htmls sent from a templating system?
06:22 < standoo1> which templating system?
06:23 < agu10^> standoo1, all?
06:23 < agu10^> i want to make it modular so people can use it in all their sites
06:24 < sambarino> i think it would be easier to do if the templating system was server side
06:24 < standoo1> isn't there server side templating like ejs, jade
06:24 < standoo1> ?
06:25 < sambarino> yeah
06:59 < owen1> i am building a node.js app that suppose to recieve 300 requests of small json objects from a queue. each object will be sent over http or save into a file and sent with ftp. how many req/sec can node handle? i am trying to estimate the number of machines i'll need (assuming 1 node per machine, 2GB RAM)
07:00 < owen1> i meant each node will recieve json from a queue and send it over http or create a file that will be sent over ftp. just wanted to clarify my previous sentence.
07:03 < ChrisPartridge> owen1: 300 requests/sec, or?
07:05 < ChrisPartridge> and why create a file and send over ftp, why not just stream?
07:11 < owen1> ChrisPartridge: if i can stream it directly that would be awesome!
07:13 < owen1> ChrisPartridge: i didn't understand your other comment. i am expecting 10 million a day, so it's about 115 per sec, but i rather get ready for more. that's how i came with 300/sec
07:13 < owen1> 300 req per second
07:13 < owen1> can i also stream the http requests?
07:17 < ChrisPartridge> owen1: stream everything
07:17 < ChrisPartridge> owen1: where do the requests come from?
07:19 < garthk> STREAM ALL THE THINGS.
07:20 < garthk> Speaking of which, I've got to stop using require('event-stream').writeArray() with JSON.stringify() and start using require('JSONStream'). Stat. 
07:22 < ChrisPartridge> garthk: es is cool though, does it play nice with 0.10.x?
07:26 < owen1> I have RabbitMQ that i am pulling messages from
07:27 < owen1> where did ChrisPartridge go?
07:27 < owen1> how can i stream to ftp without creating a file first?
07:33 < m0> Hey does anyone know if there are problems in Azure with req.ip for express 3.x?
07:35 < m0> Aha, it is behind proxies, I had to do "app.set("trust proxy", true)"
07:36 < ningu> m0: yep
07:37 < m0> I wonder if it is a bug in Express that fetching req.ip through proxy amends the port
07:50 < mscdex> owen1: pass in a stream?
08:01 < owen1> mscdex: oh. u are the author of node-ftp. thanks!
08:01 < mscdex> :-)
08:02 < sambarino> everybody's a celebrity here except me
08:02 < sambarino> :'(
08:03 < owen1> and me
08:03 < sambarino> one day we will make it
08:04 < mscdex> sambarino: get rid of IIS and you will be!
08:04 < owen1> mscdex: so can i take the json i am getting from RabbitMQ and make it a readable stream and pass it to .put ?
08:04 < sambarino> lol, i will be the iis celebrity
08:04 < mscdex> owen1: yep
08:04 < sambarino> node-iis incoming 
08:04 < sambarino> (iisnode was taken)
08:05 < owen1> mscdex: it might be stupid question, but how do i turn a json object into readable stream?
08:05 < mscdex> owen1: oh, if you just get a blob or real object, there isn't much streaming then :-)
08:06 < owen1> mscdex: i need to look at the rabbitMQ module
08:06 < mscdex> owen1: but you can stringify it and pass that to .put()
08:10 < ningu> why does IIS need its own node module?
08:12 < sambarino> i was just kidding :)
08:27 <@konobi> why not?
08:28 < mscdex> that's deep
08:30 <@konobi> mscdex: =0P
08:32 <@konobi> man, is going to take me a week or two to get back into the swing of node i reckons
08:35 <@Nexxy> konobi, :(
08:37 <@konobi> Nexxy: yeah... was pretty quiet for a while there... =0)
08:40 <@konobi> Nexxy: ignoring my invite, i see
08:44 <@Nexxy> konobi, what?!
08:45 <@Nexxy> oh lol
08:56 < whiskers75> deoxxa: any online mode support in JSMC?
09:04 < nooga> readFileSync("./foo.js") and readFileSync("./foo.json") return objects?!?!!?
09:05 < stagas> nooga: no Buffers, do readFileSync('foo', 'utf8')
09:06 < stagas> for a string
09:06 < stagas> I mean yeah Buffers
09:06 < stagas> :P
09:07 < nooga> but I just checked and readFileSync("./foo.json") returns parsed json as an object O_o
09:07 < stagas> wtf
09:08 < stagas> is it a 0.10 thing maybe?
09:20 < strk> can I specify the path to a subdir in a git repository inside package.json ?
09:20 < strk> ie: the actual module is under the src/ directory of this: git://github.com/nmrugg/LZMA-JS.git/#69c4d8dac1
09:29 < Baastrup> Hello. I'm cloning an object using Object.create(), but I have trouble inspecting them afterwards using util.inspect. Anyone has a solution for this? (I have set depth to null)
09:33 < mscdex> Baastrup: what trouble?
09:37 < Baastrup> mscdex: that I can't see the contents of the object, ie. i'm only getting {}
09:38 < RLa> mscdex, what is pre-ES5 equivalent for Object.create()?
09:39 < m0> {}
09:41 < m0> strk: just place your repo in node_modules and refer to it
09:42 < strk> m0: my question is about writing the dependency in package.json, I know how to manually craft an install
09:43 < strk> found an open issue about this: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/2974
09:44 < nooga> how do I setup dependancies to install a module that is in github private repo? I wanted to share it with collaborators as a lib
09:44 < strk> grant collaborators access to the repo
09:45 < strk> the url should be the same for all github users
09:45 < m0> strk: ah, yes, would be nice to have since as you siad some modules don't follow the proper guidelines
09:45 < strk> ssh one, github will authenticate them and see if they are allowed to access the repo
09:46 < m0> nooga: one way would be to include it as a tar gzip
09:46 < m0> nooga: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html#dependencies , "asd" : "http://asdf.com/asdf.tar.gz"
09:49 < nooga> m0 http://github.com/nooga/foobar/tarball/master gives me 404 when npm tries to download, but the link works in browser or when i call npm install <url> by hand
09:50 < Baastrup> mscdex: A gist if you are interested. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5370896
09:50 < nooga> m0: i think this has something to do with the fact that's repo is private
09:51 < Person> Guys, quick questions: I'm running a socket.io server and when someone connects to it I'm reading cookie from the socket connection. What if client has a flashcoket ? Can I still read his cookie?
09:53 < m0> nooga: I would create a script that logs into github and downloads the tarball to include in npm. There is currenly no way to authenticate downloads. To share your private repo with your team members, you have to either give it to them, or do a preinstall script.
09:54 <@Nexxy> or use a private repo
09:54 <@Nexxy> private registry*
09:55 < m0> Person: try it, yes.
09:55 < strk> m0: does package.json supports running customs scripts (to workaround the git subdir issue)
09:55 < strk> as part of 'npm install', that is
09:56 < m0> strk: thinking about your last question, couldn't you do npm install /path/to/foo/subdir ?
09:57 < strk> m0: I mean from a package having the git-module-with-subdir as a dependency
09:57  * strk wants to encode this in package.json
09:57 < m0> strk: I don't know if custom npm scripts can modify the dependencies :/
09:59 < m0> strk: you could try the preinstall script
09:59 < m0> https://npmjs.org/doc/scripts.html
09:59 < m0> strk: and install, so after a package has been installed, you move the subdirectory upwards. would that work?
10:00 < nooga> m0, They could install it globally, and the module would have a small binary (foobar init dir)
10:01 < nooga> npm link foobar will work if fooba is installed globally ?
10:01 < strk> I guess it could work to git clone on preinstall and then use the local subdir (of the cloned repo) as a dependency
10:01 <@Nexxy> why would you link it if it's already global?
10:02 < nooga> or, right
10:02 < m0> :)
10:02 < nooga> oh*
10:02 < nooga> :D
10:04 < m0> nooga: Do your users have access to the private git repo?
10:21 < leichtgewicht> Wew, I execute 3 functions with async.series and it finishes with an array with 5 entries ... 
10:22 < leichtgewicht> Somethings fishy.
10:23 <@Nexxy> leichtgewicht, your code?
10:23 < leichtgewicht> Most likely, I just wonder how I manage to get that done.
10:24 < terietor> hello
10:24 < terietor> does npm offers a way in order to find the roor dir which contains the package.json?
10:25 < mscdex> Baastrup: I believe it's because the first parameter for Object.create() is a prototype and inspect() uses hasOwnProperty()
10:27 < nooga> m0: sure
10:29 < mscdex> Baastrup: and getOwnPropertyNames
10:30 < Baastrup> mscdex: Ok, thanks for your insight. Somewhat unpractical for my purposes though, but I'll figures something out :-)
10:33 < mscdex> Baastrup: for objects like that a quick hack would be to just use a for..in
10:38 < RLa> anyone using cloudfoundry to run their node app?
10:38 < RLa> i cannot find prices anywhere
10:42 < Baastrup> mscdex: I used object.create in order to not change original properties when dealing with the new ones. But when I only need a copy of the properties, I gues a for..in makes more sense. That's what you're saying, correct?
10:57 < ElectricMaxxx> anyone worked with jade.js and rendering on clientsite?
11:02 < Ritzton> I want to test in javascript if a key exists in an array, what is the difference between ((typeof array['key']) !== "undefined") AND ("key" in array) ?
11:03 < nanashiRei> the second won't work everywhere.
11:03 < nanashiRei> the first one is weird aswell
11:04 < nanashiRei> if (array && array.key)
11:04 < skratlo> anyone knows what's the URL to get npmjs.org registry index? ie. .npm/-/all/.cache.json
11:05 < Ritzton> why the second will not work everywhere ? you mean if the array is not an array ?
11:05 < Ritzton> why the first one is weird ?
11:05 < nanashiRei> because if array is not defined it will crash
11:05 < Ritzton> because when you google it, those are the solutions given : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1098040/checking-if-an-associative-array-key-exists-in-javascript
11:06 < nanashiRei> and if you want to check if it's set, then use if (hash.keyName) { ... }
11:06 < nanashiRei> it basically does the same, with one difference
11:06 < nanashiRei> it will fail if there is any kind of empty value in it
11:06 < nanashiRei> like 0 or "" or false for that matter
11:07 < Ritzton> nanashi> which solution ?
11:09 < nanashiRei> what kind of value do you expect?
11:09 < Ritzton> I am doing this : clients[socket.id] = socket;
11:10 < nanashiRei> if (clients[id])
11:11 < nanashiRei> since a socket will not be empty
11:11 < Ritzton> and if it was a value who could be empty or null ?
11:11 < Ritzton> what should I do ?
11:14 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
11:15 < Ritzton> ?
11:15 < nanashiRei> if (typeof(clients[id]) != 'undefined')
11:15 < nanashiRei> But that would only rarely be the case
11:15 < Ritzton> I see
11:15 < nanashiRei> you really should not need to do it this way
11:16 < Ritzton> thank you for your answers nanashiRei !
11:17 < nanashiRei> sure

11:36 < skratlo> how can I make npm API calls go quiet?
11:52 < AAA_awright> nanashiRei: typeof isn't a function, so using typeof(clients[id]) isn't going to enforce order, use (typeof clients[id]) instead

13:22 < sinclair-work> hey all, look at C# copying nodejs style callbacks http://pastebin.com/e67B5VC6
13:22 < sinclair-work> pwned
13:24 < sinclair-work> in all, its been far nicer to use async/await over js callbacks. 
13:25 < sinclair-work> the whole "Task based programming" / promises style of async/await is incredibly flexible, easy as hell to write, and performant with little or no effort
13:25 < sinclair-work> it would be nice to have async/await added to TypeScript / CoffeeScript and Livescript
13:29 < boutell> sinclair-work: when you say async, do you mean the async npm nodule?
13:29 < sinclair-work> boutell: nope
13:32 < sinclair-work> boutell: i am talking about C# async / await syntax, the Task<T> types, and just how easy it is to get rockin' async performance and machine utilization out of C#, with basically next to know effort
13:32 < sinclair-work> know -> no effort
13:33 < sinclair-work> boutell: i tried the npm async package, it was awkward to work with
13:33 < boutell> there are already promises implementations for javascript. I haven't tried C# async/await, so I'm not sure if they are equivalent.
13:34 < sinclair-work> boutell: and even then, you really don't have any ability to thread heavy work with node, unless you bust out the cluster/fibre stuff
13:34 < sinclair-work> boutell: well, async/await is just syntax candy
13:34 < sinclair-work> boutell: for example....
13:34 < medice> c# is great
13:35 < sinclair-work> string html = await LoadHtmlFromSomewhereAsync(url); 
13:35 < sinclair-work> or
13:35 < hallas> there are plenty of libraries that provide async flow control in node
13:35 < sinclair-work> Task<string> task = LoadHtmlFromSomewhereAsync(url);
13:35 < sinclair-work> task.Wait();
13:35 < boutell> sinclair-work: the only "heavy work" I seem to be running into is image processing, which should be done with existing optimized tools written in C or whatever anyway, and that's what folks do; they use the node-imagemagick module, which manages imagemagick processes
13:35 < hallas> why clutter javascript with stuff that can be solved in a library?
13:35 < medice> because standard libraries provide a useful and consistent source of reusable behavior
13:35 < sinclair-work> boutell: i tend to think any work in JS is too much work
13:36 < boutell> sinclair-work: or they use a dedicated image processing service, but our needs include self-hosted operation, so node-imagemagick is better for us.
13:36 < boutell> sinclair-work: why are you here…? Just curious; you don't seem to be a node fan (:
13:36 < hallas> medice when it comes to node, the community is pretty damn good at standardizing behaviour
13:36 < sinclair-work> i am a node fan
13:36 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
13:36 < sinclair-work> i wouldn't be here otherwise
13:36 < boutell> sinclair-work: what do you like about node?
13:36 < boutell> (I am not just trolling, I am genuinely curious.)
13:37 < sinclair-work> love the single threaded event loop concurrency model, and the elegance of JS providing an interface to that through the language itself
13:37 < sinclair-work> i like how super intuitive nodejs streams are
13:38 < medice> hallas: there's also this implied quality that goes with standard libraries too, that shit gets tested
13:38 < medice> and you wont have to try guess what is a good module and what is not
13:38 < sinclair-work> medice: exactly
13:38 < boutell> streams are nice. Looking forward to more consistent implementation of pause/resume across the board in streams
13:38 < hallas> medice sinclair-work okay, but one thing is adding it as a core library, another is adding it to javascript / ecma
13:39 < hallas> which is what I understood you guys wanted
13:39 < boutell> I think the core library streams all do it well now… hopefully pause means you get no more events until you resume, otherwise you lose a lot of elegance working around that 
13:39 < medice> nah, i'm not really wanting anything, i just jumped in to the convo
13:39 < sinclair-work> hallas: it is not practical to write programs in native code
13:39 < chilts> connect-pgclient just had a new release (renamed from connect-postgres) :)
13:40 < boutell> sinclair-work: I've found that async.map, async.series, async.whilst and friends are super intuitive after a while
13:40 < boutell> also, async.mapLimit, which gives you concurrency control
13:40 < hallas> I get by with https://github.com/gett/common which has a very nice step function
13:40 < sinclair-work> hallas: applications need to be out the door asap, using something like imagemagik is fine, but if you have to do something (process this or that) you don't want to mess around writing native node modules for that
13:40 < hallas> interweaves both serial and parallel next()
13:40 < sinclair-work> boutell: yes, but what about threading?
13:41 < boutell> sinclair-work: what about threading? I agree with you that you shouldn't do heavy calculations in javascript, which leaves what use case for threading exactly?
13:41 < sinclair-work> boutell: anything that takes more than 10ms to execute > bang it in a thread pool
13:42 < hallas> sinclair-work im dumbfounded, what is it you want in regards to threads? in node?
13:43 < sinclair-work> boutell: you could try map/reduce a heavy problem into small chunks, but often that is way too complex to bother with in the majority of use cases (the ones where you just want things done)
13:43 < boutell> sinclair-work: if it takes more than 10ms to execute, it should be built out of asynchronous components. If it can't be, it's math, and it ought to be a native module or an invocation of an existing native tool.
13:44 < sinclair-work> boutell: well, i am not a fan of having to write native modules mid project to handle use case X
13:45 < hallas> be practical, what problem are we trying to solve?
13:46 < sinclair-work> hallas: its irrelevant
13:47 < hallas> if its irrelevant, then theres nothing to talk about really
13:47 < pachet> well that wraps that up
13:47 < pachet> :[
13:47 < boutell> sinclair-work: LOL.
13:48 < boutell> sinclair-work: we have a big problem because mystery thing not happening to anyone but you! 
13:48 < sinclair-work> anyway, syntactically, the C# async/await is beautiful to behold, and makes complex callback logic look remarkably straightforward, i would love to see it implemented in X -> JS compilers
13:48 < sinclair-work> boutell: do we have to get specific ?
13:48 < boutell> sinclair-work: yes we do; otherwise it's just a straw man argument.
13:48 < sinclair-work> boutell: there are plenty of problems in computer science that take a while to compute
13:48 < hallas> sinclair-work we could talk forever if this was about what features we'd like in X languages for Y number of reasons
13:49 < hallas> unless it solves Z problems
13:49 < boutell> LOL. I graduated too. Let's talk about actual problems you are trying to solve in node.
13:49 < ningu> setImmediate is useful
13:49 < boutell> process.nextTick is often the answer.
13:49 < sinclair-work> boutell: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem start here
13:50 < ningu> process.nextTick is so yesterday
13:50 < ningu> now it's all about setImmediate
13:50 < sinclair-work> boutell: i didn't even go to university
13:50 < boutell> sinclair-work: OK, you are definitely trolling.
13:50 < pachet> sinclair-work: "If  it can't be, it's math, and it ought to be a native module
13:50 < pachet> "
13:51 < hallas> let's all stop what we are doing and solve NP complete problems in polynomial time, we'll split the million dollars :p
13:51 < boutell> when it's not math, it involves I/O, and guess what? It's amenable to async.
13:51 < sinclair-work> boutell: im not, i just don't get why i need to think up some arbituary imaginary problem to discuss how it could be solved in node / node native modules, its pointless as there are infinite problems, and we could never discuss all of them in detail enough to come to any consensus on them all
13:51 < boutell> so you are not blocking.
13:51 < boutell> sinclair-work: because you are asking for changes to the language and libraries based on vigorous handwaving.
13:51 < sinclair-work> as such, im not getting into an argument about some imaginary problem
13:52 < sinclair-work> boutell: im not asking for changes to the language (JavaScript)
13:52 < boutell> that's cool, but I won't be considering your imaginary solution.
13:52 < sinclair-work> boutell: i said, "it would be nice to see async/await implemented in X > JS compiler languages i.e coffeescript)
13:52 < ningu> vigorous handwaving is dangerous, you could hit something
13:53 < ningu> sinclair-work: what about livescript? it does something very much like that
13:53 < ningu> err... sorry
13:53 < boutell> hallas: sweet. Spend the million quick before cheap cryptography breaking crashes the economy (I think? Can't remember if P=NP would be a big problem there)
13:53 < ningu> I think it's iced coffeescript
13:53 < sinclair-work> boutell: fine, how would you implement dijkstra shortest path algorithm in node?
13:53 < ningu> anyway it exists
13:53  * sinclair-work already knows the answer (put it in a native module)
13:53 < sinclair-work> ningu: hi :D
13:54 < sinclair-work> ningu: funny you should mention LiveScript actually
13:54 < pachet> "math"
13:54 < boutell> sinclair-work: yes, because even if you did use threads, it would be slow.
13:54 < ningu> http://maxtaco.github.io/coffee-script/
13:54 < boutell> and yes, math big time
13:54 < pachet> i feel like you guys are talking past each other
13:54 < hallas> sinclair-work it comes to to domains
13:54 < ningu> "IcedCoffeeScript (ICS) adds two new keywords: await and defer. These additions simply and powerfully streamline asynchronous control flow, both on the server and on the browser."
13:54 < hallas> sinclair-work node's domain is not in the scientific area
13:54 < sinclair-work> boutell: so there is the answer, every time i have a problem to solve, bang it in a native module....id rather use C# for now thanks
13:54 < ningu> hallas: that seems a bit short-sighted
13:55 < hallas> ningu you wouldnt use a hammer to put a screw in a plank of wood would you?
13:55 < sinclair-work> well, general purpose languages are still the call of the day, tho i have heard arguments otherwise
13:56 < ningu> hallas: it's not obvious to me that node is particularly poorly suited for such things. not saying it should be the first choice either -- given that we don't really have sufficient critical mass of libraries and such
13:56 < hallas> sinclair-work what you're saying it, the answer is that whenever you want to do threaded shortest path in node, you put it in a native module :P
13:56 < sinclair-work> hallas: at any rate, JS should be capable, but you need to invert all your logic to split a problem into something JS can digest without blocking
13:56 < sinclair-work> hallas: well, i wouldn't
13:56 < ningu> sinclair-work: your problem really isn't with JS at all, it's with node's event loop model
13:56 < ningu> you prefer threads it sounds like
13:56 < boutell> sinclair-work: if there's a non-trolling aspect to this conversation, it is that C# arguably has a lot of the flexibility of JavaScript *and* speed not wildly incomparable to C *and* threads, so you don't have to use a hybrid approach. The question I don't have personal experience with is whether coding in C# is actually as expressive and easy and free of annoying boilerplate as working in node. It might be. I realize i
13:56 < boutell> not Java.
13:57 < ningu> or at least you want there to be threads available
13:57 < boutell> but something is attracting you to node even though you have access to C# (:
13:57 < sinclair-work> boutell: well, ive been at it long enough to say yes, it is incredibly expressive, but i appreciate others might not think that
13:58 < hallas> the solution is simple, don't do heavy math in node
13:58 < hallas> preferably dont do math in node at all
13:58 < sinclair-work> boutell: we can all agree F# tops both JS and C#
13:58 < pachet> preferably dont do math
13:58 < hallas> pachet <3
13:59 < ningu> what about doing meth?
13:59 < hallas> not even once
13:59 < pachet> only if its in a native module
13:59 < boutell> I haven't played with F#.
14:00 < sinclair-work> boutell: node js js cool
14:00 < sinclair-work> *is
14:00 < sinclair-work> i like the principles behind node a lot, it would be better to see something other than JS over the top of it tho :P
14:00 < sinclair-work> boutell: note, ive only just started out with C#'s async await and really digging deep into it
14:00 < sinclair-work> boutell: want to look at some code?
14:00 < boutell> anyway, you can argue all day about what a general purpose programming language is. To a web developer, javascript is (pretty much) the only one, because it runs on both ends of the wire.
14:00 < boutell> sinclair-work: sure.
14:00 < boutell> sinclair-work: try reactor! It's node reimplemented in PHP! <-- So kidding. That is infinitely worse.
14:01 < sinclair-work> boutell: here is a unit test with some disk IO stuff i wrote, it uses async await, its pretty similar to node http://pastebin.com/e67B5VC6
14:01 < slicky> Is ajax.googleapis.com CDN having issues for anyone else? https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js
14:02 < ningu> slicky: fine here
14:02 < sinclair-work> boutell: if you look at the code, you see it looks a lot like JS anyway, 
14:03 < slicky> heh, set up a firewall rule that blocked that IP for google's cdn
14:03 < slicky> :x
14:03 < sinclair-work> replace method(function() { /do something/ } with method(async() => {/do something/}); 
14:03 < sinclair-work> with the added benefit of "waiting" if you wish
14:03 < boutell> sinclair-work: you're using straight-up "Wait" here a lot. That makes this code effectively single-threaded if I understand the documentation properly.
14:04 < sinclair-work> boutell: yeah, i use Wait when im outside a asynchronous method 
14:04 < hallas> i cant even load that pastebin
14:04 < hallas> its blocking 
14:05 < boutell> sinclair-work: the await keyword is interesting, sure, because as near as I can tell it yields control and then pushes back the stack and resumes later. It's an implementation of coroutines.
14:05 < sinclair-work> boutell: if you look at the code blocks inside the async() => { .. }. you'l see i await there
14:05 < boutell> sinclair-work: since you wait on each task, I don't think you're getting any benefit here.
14:05 < boutell> that doesn't mean await is useless though.
14:06 < sinclair-work> boutell: yeah, if i don't call wait, the code just continues on, but this is just a unit test anyway
14:08 < sinclair-work> boutell: its nice to have the option to wait, plus, there a a tonne of useful Task/Promise stuff in the Task<T> class, such as WaitAll, WaitAny, WhenAny, which does pretty much the job of concurrency control as you would find in async.js
14:08 < boutell> sinclair-work: I think you probably want fibers. https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers
14:09 < sinclair-work> so yeah, C# became a contender for concurrency problem with async/await
14:09 < sinclair-work> boutell: i looked at fibres before
14:09 < hallas> on a related note, Golang has a pretty sweet concurrency model
14:09 < sinclair-work> boutell: i like fibres, but i have a hell of a time getting them to run where i need them to run
14:09 < boutell> but… it still doesn't make sense to do dijkstra's in node for big datasets anyway, since we all know there are much faster languages for really tight loops. JS is fast *enough*, 100x faster or so than many other languages in a similar class of convenience, but you could thread it all day and it would still be a silly choice for math.
14:10 < sinclair-work> boutell: or, you could map/reduce the problem
14:10 < boutell> JS gets some kind of prize for being as ridiculously dynamic as it is and being fast enough that people often do that stuff in it anyway and call it good enough
14:10 < boutell> JS shouldn't be fast, it is only fast because Microsoft, Google and Firefox have all been bashing away at optimizing it for so long.
14:11 < boutell> fast-ish.
14:11 < hallas> Troll
14:11 < hallas> but I'm sure you meant Mozilla, not Firefox ;)
14:12 < sinclair-work> boutell: fast enough for a lot of stuff, and it isn't really speed that's the problem, its the blocking issues, and having to invert your code to make things work efficiently. I like to think im a pretty good programmer, but even i struggle like mad with doing things quick on node 
14:12 < sinclair-work> things get out of control quickly
14:13 < hallas> okay sinclair-work please
14:13 < hallas> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
14:13 < sinclair-work> yup
14:13 < hallas> That is what Node is built for, meant for and used for.
14:13 < sinclair-work> that pretty much sums it up
14:14 < sinclair-work> hallas: important to note, the above shouldn't necessarily include things like express
14:14 < hallas> forget about express
14:14 < sinclair-work> i hate how popular express is, its such a terrible idea
14:14 < pachet> why
14:14 < hallas> okay, lets end our current discussion and start a new one
14:14 < hallas> why is express terrible?
14:15 < totallymike> I disagree.  Express is fine.
14:15 < boutell> express is terrible because it enables me to build websites that aren't slow! Make it stop!
14:15 < sinclair-work> node shouldn't be used as a web application framework, period
14:15 < pachet> why
14:15 < hallas> haha
14:15 < hallas> troll
14:15 < hallas> discussion ends here
14:15 < totallymike> I think your definition of framework is a little screwy
14:15 < substack> I don't use express but it's not terrible.
14:15 < hallas> either very stupid or troll
14:16 < nathan7> node isn't a framework, that's the point of it
14:16 < substack> I don't think (req, res, next) middleware is a very useful approach though
14:16 < nathan7> It's all the tools you need to build one on top of
14:17 < nathan7> substack: for stuff like auth it's nice
14:17 < sinclair-work> * node shouldn't be used to "build" a web application framework. period
14:17 < totallymike> I'll bite.  Why do you say so?
14:17 < hallas> Nooooo stop please stop
14:17 < pachet> substack: i like next for pushing errors downstream
14:17 < totallymike> heeeree trolly trolly trolly heeeere trolly trolly trolly
14:17 < hallas> <3 the internet
14:18 < pachet> doing somepromise.then(someSuccessFn, next) is pretty neat
14:18 < sinclair-work> totallymike: probably my opinion, but node is best gear as pushing data around efficiently, not doing all this http processing, x middleware this and that, and gawd, html templating (jade, ejs) etc. it just isn't geared for that
14:19 < pachet> erm
14:19 < hallas> sinclair-work fact of the matter is that jade ejs processing is cached
14:19 < hallas> sinclair-work node is excellent for a number of concurrent connections
14:19 < totallymike> I think you forget that it's based in JavaScript; which was essentially born to manipulate the dom
14:19 < sinclair-work> id stop as far as using node for a rest-ful like web service, that's about it
14:19 < nathan7> Those things are still fairly I/O-bound
14:19 < totallymike> I can't think of a better language for html templating
14:19 < hallas> sinclair-work the memory model is beautiful for HTTP
14:19 < pachet> what nathan7 said times a billion
14:20 < sinclair-work> sure, you can cache, and you say things get negligible, in terms of templating, until you need dynamic templating for many many users, in which case, you are better off pushing that out to something better suited
14:20 < hallas> sinclair-work like what?
14:21 < sinclair-work> XML parsing, 
14:21 < totallymike> That's true of any language.  The more dynamic your templates the less performant your site will be, no matter what you used to build it.
14:21 < ningu> nothing is well suited for efficient XML parsing
14:21 < ningu> compared to other formats, anyway
14:21 < sinclair-work> totallymike: well, simple simple stuff, express for the win, but i wouldn't bother using it for anything else
14:21 < totallymike> ningu: least of all XML
14:22 < pachet> (sidebar, is there some undocumented flag in jshint for forcing named functions :[ )
14:22 < hallas> i dont think marshalling raw text is really efficient in any language, its just something you have to do
14:23 < totallymike> hallas: that's the jist of it
14:23 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
14:23 < nathan7> XML has too little information and too much text
14:23 < hallas> to much markup, compared to information
14:23 < totallymike> node happens to be wonderfully efficient at handling HTTP requests.  sinclair-work you can see all the massive success people have had in using it to do so as proof
14:23 < hallas> you can easily compute the ratio from format to format
14:24 < sinclair-work> totallymike: a lot of the nodejs http stuff is happening in the core libs, not in js, but it only handles the raw low level http stuff, you still need to build stuff over that, i just don't think node should be doing that
14:24 < totallymike> why?
14:24 < nathan7> substack: wut
14:24 < nathan7> sinclair-work*
14:24 < nathan7> sinclair-work: the HTTP parser is JS
14:25 < totallymike> If the core nodejs libs are so good at handling http (and they are), why shouldn't people make efforts to build lightweight scaffolding on top of it to handle more advanced things, like routing?
14:25 < sinclair-work> nathan7: i thought the node executable handled the reading of http header and body information
14:25 < totallymike> sinclair-work: nope, that's js
14:25 < sinclair-work> even worse
14:25 < hallas> sinclair-work stop procrastinating, offer some alternatives when you claim node is bad, express is bad etc
14:25 < nathan7> sinclair-work: There was a C++ parser before
14:25 < sinclair-work> terrible 
14:26 < totallymike> you forget how good v8 is at optimizing js
14:26 < sinclair-work> hallas: oh, go away
14:26 < nathan7> sinclair-work: one hand-written, one in Ragel.. and the JS one beat them both
14:26 < nathan7> V8 is pretty amazing, yeah
14:26 < sinclair-work> nathan7: yeah, v8 is pretty tops
14:26 < hallas> sinclair-work omg what is node good for then?
14:26 < totallymike> apparently attracting trolls ;)
14:27 < sinclair-work> hallas: tone it down or ill put you on ignore, i aint here trolling you, or anyone, im having a discussion and don't need you bleepin in
14:27 < ningu> sinclair-work: why assume that js is actually that slow? do you have evidence?
14:27 < sinclair-work> also, read what i said already
14:27 < ningu> sinclair-work: I mean, people do the same in ruby, python etc. what's the big deal?
14:28 < sinclair-work> ningu: its not that its slow
14:28 < sinclair-work> ningu: its that it blocks
14:28 < totallymike> you mention vaguaries like pushing data around.  That's what HTTP is for.
14:28 < boutell> here is an actual question: after attaching the node debugger to a process I always get "can't request backtrace now" when I type bt. This despite the fact that the process is using 100% CPU, so it sure seems stuck in a loop, and I'd love to know where (:
14:28 < totallymike> sinclair-work: what blocks?
14:28 < ningu> sinclair-work: parsing the http header won't block for very long.
14:29 < totallymike> plus everything has to block somewhere
14:29 < sinclair-work> ningu: sure, i appreciate that, but it adds up
14:29 < totallymike> no more than unicorn blocks or php blocks
14:29 < sinclair-work> totallymike: i don't disagree
14:29 < totallymike> actually probably less than unicorn; each http request isn't a different thread
14:29 < sinclair-work> totallymike: however, consider the hassle in using clustering in nodejs, and compare it with the simplicity of other things out there
14:29 < totallymike> er it blocks more than unicorn
14:30 < totallymike> like what?
14:30 < totallymike> define the hassles involved in clustering that aren't present elsewhere
14:30 < sinclair-work> blocking, non performant code is unavoidable, the ability to delegate processing out to multiple cores is a largely solved problem (even in node), however, node makes it far more complicated 
14:31 < sinclair-work> well, far more complicated than it needs to be
14:31 < totallymike> how so?
14:31 < totallymike> I honestly don't know what issues you've had in making it complicated
14:32 < ningu> isn't it just a require('cluster') and a simple loop at the beginning?
14:32 < sinclair-work> totallymike: well, for one, arbitrary spawning a thread in node is like stabbing myself in the eye. (and i have tried fibres)
14:32 < rwaldron> Domenic_ ping
14:33 < hallas> theoretical discussions are completely useless in this context, node has a very specific domain on which it solves the problems not only quickly, but efficiently and easily manageable
14:33 < sinclair-work> ningu: processing logic may be nested down deep in the innards or your application
14:33 < rwaldron> Domenic_ when you get a chance, I need you to look at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13768 and advise—Thanks!!
14:33 < sinclair-work> ningu: we can argue that as a good or bad point, but the matter is, spawning a thread to do somework is not trivial in node
14:33 < totallymike> sinclair-work: perhaps spawning threads is a nightmare, I don't know.  But once you establish your threading mechanism, it's set.
14:33 < hallas> claiming that express is horrible, not offering any explanation is trolling, not matter how you put it
14:33 < sinclair-work> totallymike: well, i tend to think there are many different ways to thread
14:34 < totallymike> You can't parallelize too much of the process of serving an HTTP request because it's justa  pipeline
14:34 < totallymike> I mean, what else would you parallize beyond the workers that handle the requests?
14:34 < sinclair-work> totallymike: a model may not be applicable in all cases
14:34 < slicky> "You're doing it wrong."
14:34 < sinclair-work> totallymike: anything at all
14:34 < GOMADWarrior> does node.js have sockets?
14:34 < totallymike> So you find the one that works for your application, get it working, and then it's done
14:34 < totallymike> GOMADWarrior: I love you
14:34 < totallymike> sinclair-work: define anything at all
14:35 < sinclair-work> totallymike: sigh, anything bit of processing that takes more than 10ms to complete
14:35 < totallymike> like what?
14:35 < sinclair-work> does it matter?
14:35 < totallymike> what parts of serving an http request would you parallelize, give me an example
14:35 < totallymike> it does
14:35  * sinclair-work wonders why people think that matters
14:35 < sinclair-work> dijstras shorted path algo then
14:36 < totallymike> I don't know what that is.
14:36 < sinclair-work> maybe, levensteins distance
14:36 < hallas> lol
14:36 < hallas> just lol
14:36 < totallymike> Nor why you would parallelize it in the context of serving HTTP requests.
14:36 < sinclair-work> totallymike: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
14:36 < sinclair-work> totallymike: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
14:37 < sinclair-work> ^ you want examples, as irrelevant as they are
14:37 < sinclair-work> they take more than 10ms to compute, and waaay longer for large datasets
14:38 < guybrush> sinclair-work: so do that part of your app not in js :D
14:38 < totallymike> and why do you need to process them in each http request?
14:38 < totallymike> and if so, wouldn't the rest of the request wait on your parallelized algo processing thread anyway?
14:38 < sinclair-work> totallymike: i may wish to compare two documents, or find the shortest route between two locations on a map?
14:39 < sinclair-work> ^ arbitrary irrelevant example
14:39 < totallymike> but if you do so by spawning a separate thread, what's the win?
14:39 < guybrush> also you can run multiple processes anyway
14:39 < sinclair-work> totallymike: don't get too hung on what the algo, or whatever, just consider that there are problems that take a while to compute, and it would be cool to be able to spawn a thread to to that work
14:40 < slicky> Why can't you spawn a new thread. It's relatively simple in my experience
14:40 < guybrush> whats the super advantage over spawning multiple processes?
14:40 < sinclair-work> totallymike: well, CPU utilization for one, and on blocking on the "main" thread
14:40 < boutell> tell you what, I'm glad my brain is async, because if I were blocking on this infinite loop of a non-conversation, I'd be starved for cycles by now.
14:40 < hallas> ^^
14:40 < hallas> you'd be dead
14:40 < pachet> boutell: this convo is an async req gone out to lunch
14:40 < totallymike> It's not about what the algo is; if you spawn a separate thread to handle that work, how is it freeing up the http request thread that needs that work from waiting for it to finish?
14:40 < sinclair-work> boutell: yes, its getting a bit old
14:40  * sinclair-work notes, he is not trolling
14:41 < sinclair-work> why do people in here think that
14:41 < hallas> becuase you are ridicolous
14:41 < thomblake> That's exactly what a troll would say.
14:41 < slicky> because I don't think you understand the problem you're explaining
14:41 < sinclair-work> hallas: in what way?
14:41 < guybrush> trolls always say they dont troll :>
14:41 < slicky> and you're trying to go about solving it in the wrong way
14:41 < sinclair-work> slicky: well, if i was forced into doing things like this in node, i would probably opt for a native node module
14:42 < sinclair-work> 1) native node module
14:42 < hallas> you're complaining that your newly bought fridge can't heat up stuff
14:42 < sinclair-work> 2) map reduce
14:42 < sinclair-work> 3) network service / named pipe thing out to something else
14:42 < sinclair-work> probable in that order
14:42 < slicky> I work on a project with huge computation happening on http/socket requests and we have no problems
14:42 < sinclair-work> hallas: i am not complaining, now go away
14:43 < sinclair-work> slicky: yeah, so you do all your processing in socket bound native components ?
14:43 < totallymike> sinclair-work: I think you refuse to understand
14:44 < sinclair-work> ...
14:44 < pachet> hallas: i bet if we can get the compressor to leak hot freon, we can heat up stuff!
14:44 < totallymike> Okay.  Say you receive a request for something, and the response requires intensive computation
14:44 < sinclair-work> yes
14:44 < totallymike> And, for some reason, you must process that computation each time you receive the request
14:44 < hallas> pachet thats why i chose that metaphor, you can make a fridge heat your shit, but its still stupid
14:44 < sinclair-work> yup
14:44 < pachet> hallas ;]
14:44 < totallymike> sinclair-work: how does spawning a separate thread to handle the computation save you any time?
14:45 < hallas> sinclair-work Okay, so, on my project we have a lot of machine learning
14:45 < pachet> totallymike: only because you can optimize math if you do it natively
14:45 < hallas> sinclair-work we solved that issue by not complaining, but instead using mahout and hadoop in another aws instance
14:45 < sinclair-work> hallas: i don't care about your project
14:45 < pachet> that's assuming you're doing math i guess
14:45 < sinclair-work> hallas: now go away
14:46 < hallas> sinclair-work please be nice to me
14:46 < medice> what's commonly used for browser side js for events?
14:46 < medice> any libraries or patterns for that?
14:46 < sinclair-work> totallymike: im really not interested in carrying on this conversation, but i will answer your threading question
14:46 < hallas> medice i guess jquery can solve that
14:47 < pachet> medice: some library that does pubsub or mediator
14:47 < sinclair-work> totallymike: i am quite used to having a fixed thread pool, with each thread services requests, when a request comes in, it is accepted by one thread on the pool, and some processing happens and returns
14:47 < pachet> backbone!
14:47 < totallymike> I argue that spawning a thread to handle the computation saves you no time and this is why:
14:47 < sinclair-work> totallymike: this is pretty common place on most web services
14:47 < sinclair-work> *servers
14:47 < matts1> nimp oO
14:47 < totallymike> The rest of the request takes virtually no time to handle; rendering templates, routing, etc are very quick or at least quick enough
14:48 < hallas> totallymike it's not time complex, which is the important part
14:48 < sinclair-work> totallymike: did you want me to finish answering?, or can i go?
14:48 < totallymike> so that stuff will be done long before your computation is finished anyway.  The gain you receive by adding threads to handle the computation are minimal
14:48 < totallymike> please do answer
14:50 < sinclair-work> totallymike: you have a threadpool servicing http requests, http request is accepted on one of these threads, and if that thread requires heavy lifting, it pushes that work out to a background worker, (thread), while that work continues in the background, the original thread used to accept the http request is returned to the thread pool
14:50 < sinclair-work> totallymike: ^ pretty standard stuff
14:51 < sinclair-work> anyway, you get advantages doing things this way
14:51 < totallymike> Of course.  But in this case, how does the return from your heavy lifting get back to the original request if the thread is returned to the pool?
14:51 < sinclair-work> 1) better CPU utilization 
14:51 < sinclair-work> 2) configurable thread pool sizes
14:51 < totallymike> I'm aware of those benefits
14:52 < sauoq> configurable thread pool sizes are an "advantage" of using thread pools?
14:52 < sinclair-work> sure, well, these are pretty good when contrasted with nodes single threaded approach, and you were talking about accepting http through node, soooo
14:52 < der_On> hi. Is there a web based  node.js server management available? I host multiple node-apps on one server and would like to be able to manage them through a nice UI
14:52 < sinclair-work> sauoq: sure, they are
14:53 < puckey00> does anyone here have any experiences with memory leaks when doing batch puts using levelup?
14:53 < Sly> Are there any plans to support X509/RSA/etc in Node?
14:54 < sauoq> Eh... no. They aren't an advantage. They are a requirement if you want useful thread pools. Nothing about "configurable thread pools" is a priori an advantage over anything (except having fixed thread pool sizes, I suppose.) 
14:54 < totallymike> heh that's true.  Having a gas pedal isn't an advantage having a car gives you, it's something that makes the car useful
14:55 < sinclair-work> totallymike: it was nice chatting dude, i gotta get back to work. 
14:55 < totallymike> But I do see his point; thread pools make it easy to decide how to scale your server
14:55 < totallymike> fun as always
14:56 < sinclair-work> for sure
14:58 < sinclair-work> totallymike: before i go tho, what do you think the chance are of a fibre like framework being added to the nodejs core
14:58 < sinclair-work> ?
14:58 < sinclair-work> that would be awesome
14:59 < totallymike> sinclair-work: Honestly, I don't know much about fibers
15:00 < totallymike> People like them, so I hope somebody hacks on it
15:00 < thomblake> It's been hacked on to death and back.  I would bet against it in the next year and a half or so.
15:01 < sinclair-work> totallymike: maybe they not not necessary, you could problem get a thread pool like behavior setting up a cluster, and piping work items to it
15:01 < sinclair-work> oh, its late
15:01 < sinclair-work> c yas
15:01 < GOMADWarrior> I was reading a tutorial about node.js
15:02 < GOMADWarrior> but it isn't complete, you have to buy it :(
15:02 < jjmaddison> hi
15:02 < jjmaddison> Is it a good practice to set NODE_PATH=. ?
15:03 < jjmaddison> I want to require('model/users') and alike..
15:09 < jjmaddison> just in case this channel is alive...
15:10 < jjmaddison> is Fibers good for real production?
15:10 < slicky> say something bad about node is a good way to get a lot of people talking
15:10 < inspiron> i have to do gui testing. what framework is most suggested now? phantomJS?
15:12 < jjmaddison> inspiron: Selenium is best
15:12 < jjmaddison> other are inferior
15:12 < jjmaddison> ouch, Selenium is not node.js
15:12 < jjmaddison> cause node.js-based e2e testing frameworks SUCK
15:13 < jjmaddison> inspiron: thanks for helping me to say smth bad about node
15:13 < jjmaddison> phantomjs semi-sucks
15:15 <@isaacbw> testacular is neat
15:15 < jjmaddison> karma e2e testing?
15:15 < jjmaddison> very raw.
15:16 < jjmaddison> I'd look at it after half year
15:16 < jjmaddison> probably.
15:18 < shanimal> have you seen this karma/testacular video www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVw8N3hTfCI
15:19 < shanimal> nice workflow, walks through the setup in sublime and jetbrains
15:20 <@isaacbw> I think the idea of CI with frontend development is awesome
15:21 < jjmaddison> Well, at least one of angular creators recommends Selenium for E2E testing
15:21 < jjmaddison> instead of testacular
15:21 <@isaacbw> interesting
15:21 < jjmaddison> (or whatever you call it)
15:21 < jjmaddison> https://groups.google.com/d/msg/karma-users/nPGnJzEf6mw/vvCGCrXMZf0J
15:21 <@isaacbw> yea I didn't notice the brand change
15:21 < shanimal> makes it a biotch to find docs
15:21 < jjmaddison> actually, karma e2e testing is purely js based right?
15:22 <@isaacbw> which honestly I think is a good change. Testacular always made me think testicular
15:22 < jjmaddison> ;)
15:22 < jjmaddison> indeed.
15:23 < shanimal> yeah pretty much end end to end. its a test runner that brings the test to command line so jenkins can take it and run with it
15:23 < shanimal> theres a plugin karma-grunt i think as well
15:24 < boutell> gomadwarrior: if you're still here, there's a tutorial at justjs.com, and many others that are free. 
15:25 < shanimal> grunt karma:continuous from the command line returns 0 or 1 for test results
15:25 < shanimal> so none of that hacky searching through xml file stuff
15:25 < jjmaddison> Eh
15:25 < jjmaddison> AngularJS being Google is both + and -
15:26 < jjmaddison> well, nevermind offtopic
15:26 <@isaacbw> it's open source, so if anything goes wrong it would be pretty easy to fork and keep going
15:26 < jjmaddison> could you please comment on the idea of NODE_PATH=. ?
15:26 < jjmaddison> is it a good practice?
15:26 < jjmaddison> (Express app)
15:30 < happyface> are there any node.js irc clients to connect web users to a network?
15:31 < shanimal> jjmaddison: i dunno. i thought the point of the pkg mgmt is to have all the dependencies come to you :)
15:33 < petecoop> happyface, loads. Have a look at https://github.com/cjstewart88/nirc
15:33 < happyface> petecoop: cool, I gave up on hacking qwebirc
15:35 < petecoop> happyface, although it looks pretty old now and not actively worked on - it's just something I have starred
15:37 < happyface> petecoop: I just need something _very_ simple and that can auto connet with a random username (or I can have it if needed). You're the developer for nirc?
15:38 < happyface> s/have it/hack it/
15:38 < petecoop> happyface, no I'm not it's just something I've come across and just thought it looked good and I'd use it sometime but never did
15:39 < dcholth> Hello, has anyone here installed a NodeJS/Express app on Bluehost?

15:50 < dcholth> Does anyone have an opinion on Stackful.io  for node app hosting?
15:55 < addisonj> hrm, how has everyone elses moves to 10.x gone? 
15:55 < RLa> anyone run their app on cloundfoundry?
15:56 < RLa> i moved to master branch and it works fine :)
15:57 < deoxxa> addisonj: great!
15:57 < deoxxa> addisonj: of course, i was moving from 0.9... so... probably a bit of a different experience
15:57 < addisonj> deoxxa: heh, probably
15:58 < addisonj> were you running 0.9 in production setting?
15:58 < addisonj> because that sounds brave
15:59 < deoxxa> nah, development
15:59 < deoxxa> oh, actually
15:59 < deoxxa> since about 0.9.9 i was running a couple of things in production
15:59 < deoxxa> most was still 0.8 though
16:00 < owen1> i am building a node.js app that suppose to recieve 300 requests per second of a small json objects from a RabbitMQ. each json object will be recieved by the node process, and node will send it away over http or save into a file and sent with ftp. how many req/sec can a single node handle? i am trying to estimate the number of machines i'll need (assuming 1 node per machine, 2GB RAM)
16:00 < RLa> dcholth, isn't that generic vps hosting?
16:00 < petecoop> anybody know of something similar to https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu ? perhaps with a bit more active development?
16:00 < ningu> owen1: probably depends on cpu speed too...
16:00 < context> owen1: why save a file and then ftp it, why not just ftp it ?
16:00 < deoxxa> owen1: how long is a piece of string
16:00 < owen1> context: i am getting a json object from Rabbit
16:01 < context> yes i read that part
16:01 < owen1> context: can i turn a json object into readable string?
16:01 < deoxxa> ...
16:01 < owen1> deoxxa: about 500 chars(bytes)
16:01 < lacrymology> can someone explain to me why is it bad to define the prototype functions within the constructor itself?
16:01 < context> JSON.stringify() im pretty sure does that i looked
16:01 < lacrymology> I've been told it was bad, but no explanation was offered
16:01 < owen1> context: oh. sweet
16:02 < context> ... im confused now
16:02 < context> writing to a file is the only way you thought to make json readable ?
16:02 < context> avoid the disk... thats gonna be your biggest bottleneck if you do that.
16:02 < kenperkins> bnoordhuis around?
16:03 < owen1> context: ok. JSON.stringify() will create readablestream, which i can pipe to the ptf module - .put(myStream
16:03 < RLa> dcholth, they do not seem to have been around for longer time, i would not trust any hosting provider who has operated less than couple of years
16:04 < owen1> deoxxa: can i assume about 50 requests per second?  (i used jmeter on a previous project. it was http endpoint, but the same hardware)
16:04 < context> owen1: you have a lot of different things you are measuring
16:05 < context> you said 2G of ram
16:05 < deoxxa> owen1: you can assume whatever you like, but it's meaningless until you actually test it
16:05 < context> is it a Pentium w/ MMX ? are you on a 56K modem?
16:06 < context> with just about any machine by todays standards if what you are doing is truly as simple as you say it is, id imagine 300 req/s should probably be a drop in the bucket
16:07 < owen1> context: so i need to build a little script that add messages to a rabbitMQ and measure it myself, right? there is no tool that can do that for me.
16:07 < happyface> proxy_pass is turning POST requests into GET requests, is there anything I can do?
16:08 < MI6> joyent/libuv: isaacs created tag v0.10.4 - http://git.io/bzEOXg
16:16 < h22> Need opinions. Would using express for making a json api and Ember for the frontend be an overkill?
16:16 < Siyfion> h22: Why would it be?
16:16 < GOMADWarrior> how do I sockets?
16:17 < Siyfion> h22: Depends on the application you are writing I guess, but that seems a perfectly valid approach
16:17 < Siyfion> GOMADWarrior: Looked at socket.io?
16:17 < GOMADWarrior> isn't that for the browser?
16:18 < Siyfion> GOMADWarrior: no, it's for both.
16:18 < Siyfion> GOMADWarrior: Although reading the second line on this page would have told you that: http://socket.io/#how-to-use
16:19 < Siyfion> GOMADWarrior: "Using with Node HTTP server"
16:19 <@isaacs> Domenic__: it's true.  I have been reduced.
16:20 < kenperkins> isaacs: any idea how to debug why I started seeing TLS UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE from 0.8 to 0.10? service provider is certain their SSL certs are all configured correctly
16:20 < webdesserts> isaacs: looking forward to hearing your talk Monday :)
16:21 < killerstorm> hi. I've installed node from source. There is no node-waf.Why?
16:21 < killerstorm> Is node-waf a separate package? 
16:21 < webdesserts> killerstorm: node-gyp replaced node-waf to my knowledge
16:22 < GOMADWarrior> do I need visual studio
16:22 < Siyfion> GOMADWarrior: For what?
16:22 < deoxxa> GOMADWarrior: you also need audible studio
16:22 < Siyfion> GOMADWarrior: Generally? No. lol

16:48 < kenperkins> isaacs: bummed I wont get to meet you next week (openstack summit) but nodeconf will have to do
16:48 <@isaacs> kenperkins: yes :)
16:48 <@isaacs> kenperkins: so, for them, they need to send teh ca certs as well as their own cert
16:48 < kenperkins> btw, rackspace is officially contributing to nodejitsu's pkgcloud
16:48 < kenperkins> isaacs: yea I saw that immediatley (missing CA certs in the chain)
16:49 < kenperkins> isaacs: once you showed the output that is
16:49 <@isaacs> usually what happens is that the CA mints a special signing certificate from their "main" certificate, and then uses that to sign your tls keys
16:49 < cxreg> is there a node lint that works in 0.8/0.10?
16:49 <@isaacs> but no one knows about that intermediate cert
16:49 <@isaacs> it helps the CA keep their main cert a bit more locked-down via defense in depth.  if one of the intermediate certs is ever compromised, then they can contain the damage much more effectively than if their main cert is compromised.
16:50 <@isaacs> kenperkins: in node, i do this for npm-www:
16:50 <@isaacs>   exports.https = {
16:50 <@isaacs>     key: fs.readFileSync('ssl/server.key'),
16:50 <@isaacs>     cert: fs.readFileSync('ssl/server.crt'),
16:50 <@isaacs>     passphrase: fs.readFileSync('ssl/passphrase.txt', 'utf8').trim(),
16:50 <@isaacs>     ca: require('./ca.js')
16:50 <@isaacs>   }
16:50 <@isaacs> kenperkins: that's in teh config.admin.js ^
16:50 < kenperkins> sweet thx
16:50 <@isaacs> kenperkins: ca.js just is module.exports = [ list of ca cert strings ]

16:58 < doug> evanmoran: well, that spot is getting the wrong self, i'm sure.
16:58 < doug> because of my override
16:58 < doug> i'm not doing it correctly somehow.
16:58 < evanmoran> do you by chance mean `this`?
16:59 < doug> no clue, it's node (net.js), not my code.

17:11 < evanmoran> I teared up at the stream: unshift() paragraph
17:11 <@isaacbw> doug: what would it do
17:12 < pachet> manage the users!
17:12 <@isaacbw> woo
17:12 < doug> with a stick, if possible.
17:12 < doug> isaacbw: handle user registration, give a user object framework, implement a base "my account" page, etc.
17:13 < doug> things that every site with user registration has to deal with
17:13 <@isaacbw> so you want.. a website?
17:13 < doug> who doesn't?
17:13 <@isaacbw> woo, websites
17:14 < doug> thinking of something like http://usercake.com/
17:14 < doug> but not so much php
17:14 < s5fs> i'm having trouble getting node to run on my aol homepage
17:14 < s5fs> should i try geocities instead?
17:14 < puckey00> anyone have any experience with memory leaks with batch puts & levelup?
17:14 <@isaacbw> you won't be able to find something like that
17:14 < h22> s5fs: Yes! They're cool!
17:15 < doug> google gives me a couple things, https://npmjs.org/package/users-node looks potentially workable
17:15 < s5fs> h22: awesome thanks, wanna join my webring?
17:16 <@isaacbw> doug: look through the source of that
17:16 <@isaacbw> and you'll see why using it would be silly
17:16 < doug> webrings are cool.  especially when they have logos with wolves and star backgrounds.
17:16 < h22> s5fs: But seriously, I'm too young to know what a webring is.. 
17:16 <@isaacbw> you could base your own shit on it though
17:16 < doug> hm, 136 lines of not much.
17:17 < zomg> webrings, how bad sites got traffic
17:17 < s5fs> h22: haha! oh man, that's awesome.
17:18 < s5fs> h22: your kids won't have any idea why the "save icon" is a floppy disk, or why the "contacts" icon is a rolodex. "radio buttons" what?
17:19 < h22> s5fs: Newer icon themes don't use the floppy disk icon already.. 
17:19 < h22> skeumorphism phail. 
17:19 < s5fs> haha indeed
17:20 < s5fs> so what's the new icon?
17:20 < h22> It's much like the download icon.. 
17:20 < h22> a down arrow.. 
17:21 < doug> i prefer the true old-school icon.  a smiling girl i can order around to do my work for me.
17:21 < doug> all the icons should be that.

17:37 <@isaacbw> cropping would probably be the most immediately useful feature
17:37 < nathan7> jjmaddison: .resume() your stream
17:37 < bmatusiak> @isaacbw http://editor.pixastic.com/ this link is what I'm aiming for
17:37 < jjmaddison> nathan7: ?
17:37 < nathan7> jjmaddison: it won't start spitting data until someone listens for data events (streams1 style)
17:38 < nathan7> jjmaddison: streams2 use a .read(), a stream doesn't end until all data has been read from it
17:38 < jjmaddison> please take a look at the code
17:38 < nathan7> jjmaddison: .resume() will enable old behaviour
17:38 < jjmaddison> http://pastebin.com/ZU9wBf0X
17:38 < jjmaddison> how should I change it to adapt the "new style" (tm) ?
17:38 < jjmaddison> why on POST, there are 'data' and 'end' events, and on GET there are none?
17:38 < jjmaddison> ,
17:38 < nathan7> there are
17:39 < nathan7> You're not listening for data, so streams1 behaviour is not activated
17:39 < nathan7> .resume() will bring you streams1 behaviour for this case
17:39 < jjmaddison> maybe I should switch to streams2 ?
17:39 < jjmaddison> just fix the code?
17:39 < nathan7> Why the hell are you even waiting for end there?
17:39 < nathan7> You can just serve the file right away
17:40 < jjmaddison> actually, that's from node-static module page
17:40 < jjmaddison> and this code worked
17:40 < nathan7> there won't ever be any data for a GET
17:40 < jjmaddison> it stopped worked recently, that's why I started to wonder
17:40 < jjmaddison> and for POST ... ?
17:40 < jjmaddison> should I continue using data and end?
17:40 < nathan7> http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/12/20/streams2/
17:41 < jjmaddison> thanks!
17:41 < jjmaddison> I'll read this one now
17:41 < jjmaddison> is it ok to update to 0.10 btw?
17:42 < webdesserts> jjmaddison: that would just depend on any code you already have in place
17:42 < nathan7> There's still a lot going on in 0.10
17:43 < harrisonm> jjmaddison: Do what I didn't do and run your environment on 0.10 locally before you upgrade
17:43 < jjmaddison> harrisonm: =)
17:43 < jjmaddison> I have a new project
17:44 < jjmaddison> actually, the point is the existing modules
17:44 < jjmaddison> like express etc
17:44 < jjmaddison> are they mostly up2date
17:44 <@isaacbw> harrisonm: oy, did you really upgrade in production without testing it?
17:44 < harrisonm> isaacbw: "production" being my personal server with a few random school projects on it, yeah

18:18 < dNb> Hi there
18:18 < dNb> I cant intall NODEJS in CENTOS 5
18:19 < dNb> is there someone who may help?
18:20 < s5fs> dNb: how are you peforming the install? what errors are you getting?
18:21 < dNb> Im installing by putty... ssh
18:22 < s5fs> dNb: okay, you're connected to your server via ssh, that's good.
18:22 < dNb> Traceback (most recent call last):

18:23 < dNb> I have Python 2.7.3
18:23 < s5fs> dNb: okay, sounds like a permissions issue. I assume you're trying to install from source (ie, download the source code, run ./configure; make; make install)
18:23 < s5fs> dNb: how did you get the source? I usually just use "wget"
18:24 < s5fs> dNb: are you following an install guide or just winging it?
18:24 < dNb> yes.. wget.. i want to installl the lateste veresion, but there is no ./configure script
18:24 < s5fs> dNb: okay, I just installed node 0.10.x yesterday, here is an overview of what I did
18:25 < s5fs> dNb: 1) wget http://source.tgz  2) tar -xzvf source.tgz  3) cd source-directory  4) ./configure
18:25 < dNb> I did it..
18:25 < s5fs> dNb: note that I'm using the same unpriviledged user for all of this, not root.
18:26 < dNb> [/usr/local/src/node-v0.10.3-linux-x64]# ./configure -bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
18:26 < s5fs> dNb: i only use root for "make install"
18:26 < mrvisser> hmm, anyone know of a tcp-level load-balancer / proxy I can embed in nodejs like haproxy?
18:27 < s5fs> dNb: I think you may be grabbing the binaries, not the source
18:27 < s5fs> dNb: wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.4/node-v0.10.4.tar.gz instead
18:28 < s5fs> dNb: I haven't done a binary install of node, so I can't speak to the process.
18:30 < dNb> YES!!
18:30 < dNb> That was my mistake
18:30 < dNb> that was my mistake
18:30 < dNb> thanx a lot
18:30 < dNb> s5fs: tnx!
18:31 < s5fs> dNb: no problem, glad to help!
18:31 < dNb> s5fs: get same error with 8.x
18:31 < dNb> IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: './config.gypi'
18:32 < dNb> Is it privilege error?
18:32 < CoverSlide> usually what permission denied means
18:32 < s5fs> it sounds like it, what are the perms on that file?
18:32 < dNb> Dunno.. how to see?
18:33 < s5fs> ls -l config.gypi
18:34 < s5fs> dNb: this is with 0.8.x?
18:34 < dNb> no.. with 0.10.4

18:35 < s5fs> dNb: when do you get that error?

18:40 < logicalcat> hi all, Express.js question: Is it possible to hide a "block content" (in a jade template) via jquery or another action?
18:40 < s5fs> dNb: okay, sounds like you don't really own the files in that directory. you have a couple of options
18:41 < s5fs> dNb: 1) figure out how to fix the permissions. this is recommended as you'll both solve the problem AND learn more about unix permissions, which is good.
18:41 < dNb> but I have root access
18:41 < s5fs> dNb: 2) sudo to root and do all the work as root
18:41 < dNb> to the main server
18:41 < dNb> but want instal in this user
18:41 < s5fs> dNb: sure, but root is a dangerous user account and it's generally bad practice to run as root unless you can avoid it.
18:42 < dNb> Oooo good to know
18:42 < s5fs> dNb: if this isn't a production server and you're just learning, then it's okay to play fast and loose. just be mindful that you are not following best practices.
18:43 < dNb> its production server..
18:43 < dNb> boss want to install node  :(
18:43 < dNb> But if it crash ill be guilty
18:43 < s5fs> dNb: friend, i strongly encourage you to shore up your linux knowledge if you're going to be configuring production systems.
18:44 < s5fs> dNb: crashing is one thing, i'd worry about someone hacking the server. if your server is inside your lan and accessible via pinhole firewalling, someone could really do some damage. 
18:44 < s5fs> dNb: the internet is an aggressive place, it's crazy.
18:44 < s5fs> dNb: here's my advice for the install. 
18:45 < dNb> Thanx
18:45 <@isaacs> kenperkins: nothing.
18:45 < s5fs> dNb: 1) log in as a "normal user"  2) wget the source, unzip it, cd into the directory and run "./configure; make;"
18:45 <@isaacs> kenperkins: ie, those deps won't be there.
18:45 < s5fs> dNb: 3) assuming all goes well, run "sudo make install"
18:46 < s5fs> dNb: it appers that you are in a directory owned by root or something, that's why you're having permission issues.
18:46 < s5fs> dNb: i'd also be very clear with your boss that you are happy to help, but are inexperienced (but learning quickly!) and cannot speak to the overall security and stability of this machine.
18:47 < dNb> hmmm
18:47 < s5fs> dNb: get it in writing, via email. just be up-front and try to pass the risk back up the chain. if this thing goes wonko you want to ensure you were clear about your experience level. the time to manage expectations is now.
18:48 < s5fs> nobody knows everything, and that's okay. we learn through reading and doing, and doing means "making mistakes". during a learning phase you want to insulate yourself from risk as much as possible.
18:48 < s5fs> dNb: if you don't have a development server, get one. avoid doing "first time" work on the production server.
18:48 < dNb> ok.. thank you priceless advices!
18:49 < dNb> last question... the people use to install in specific directory?
18:49 < s5fs> dNb: happy to help, best of luck getting node working :)
18:50 < s5fs> dNb: when you run "sudo make install" it will drop the binaries in the correct locations
18:50 < dNb> doesnt matter where i did wget?
18:50 < s5fs> that's why you need to run it with "sudo"
18:50 < dNb> ok... 
18:50 < dNb> I understood..
18:50 < s5fs> dNb: nope. I have a ~/node/ directory and wget files into there. then I have ~/node/node-version/ directories
18:51 < s5fs> I cannot log into any of my servers as root, and really try to avoid using root except via "sudo"
18:51 < dNb> right
18:52 < s5fs> dNb: so, the long and short is that you can download source and compile it anywhere, as any user. it's only during install ("make install") that you need root privs.
18:53 < dNb> hmmm
18:53 < dNb> thank you bout your time
18:54 < dNb> bye
18:54 < s5fs> dNb: no problem, happy to help. once you get your legs under you, i hope you'll come back and help other newbies :)
18:54 < s5fs> take care!
18:58 < dNb> s5fs: Success!.. ive created a directory... everything is going nice
18:58 < dNb> typed make
18:59 < dNb> without sudo
18:59 < dNb> Ive created a ~/node
19:00 < dNb> make was cool
19:00 < dNb> make install nota at all
19:00 < janmower> also if you're on centos look at checkinstall (iso running `make install` you run `make checkinstall` and it makes an rpm)
19:00 < janmower> it's helpful when you're trying to install to many systems
19:01 < dNb> with sudo it gonne

20:01 < CoverSlide> whoa
20:02 < CoverSlide> crazy
20:02 < CoverSlide> never used SSE's before
20:02 < CoverSlide> learn something new every day
20:03 < happyface> CoverSlide: yeah they are pretty awesome. Looks like firefox works the same way with tabs
20:04 < happyface> whatever, it works... ship it to production!!
20:12 < jjore> Is there a recommended lint? I installed lint@1.1.2 but this thing apparently supports node 0.2.1.
20:13 < harrisonm> jjore: JSHint?
20:18 < Sven_vB> jslint
20:18 < CoverSlide> people tend to like jshint more than jslint
20:18 < CoverSlide> jjore: does it not work?
20:19 < CoverSlide> if it works, why complain?
20:19 < Sven_vB> that's just another form of not liking jslint
20:19 < jjore> I didn't know to use /that/ one yet.
20:20 < jjore> the lint module didn't work on node 0.8.16 and I didn't know which one to use yet.
20:21 < pandeiro> npm have a manpage?
20:21 < CoverSlide> npm faq
20:22 < s5fs> pandeiro: also, https://npmjs.org/doc/
20:24 < GOMADWarrior> what does this do? $clientCounter.html(msg.clients);
20:26 < BOY77X> http://xxxsexygifsxxx.blogspot.com/2013/04/kim-kardashian-hot-collection.html
20:26 < pachet> BOY77X, you fox
20:26 < CoverSlide> jjore: i tend to not trust packages whose age is measured in years
20:26 < pandeiro> how can i update a local node package for use on the system? ie in /usr/bin/
20:26 < CoverSlide> jjore: jslint or jshint are your best bets
20:27 < CoverSlide> jjore: jshint tends to be less restrictive though, and a bit more node-focused
20:28 < pandeiro> `sudo npm install -g` in the package's directory?
20:29 < CoverSlide> pandeiro: um what?
20:29 < CoverSlide> pandeiro: what are you trying to accomplish?
20:29 < pandeiro> CoverSlide: upgrade a package that hasn't been upgraded in the npm repo
20:29 < pandeiro> to use master
20:30 < CoverSlide> pandeiro: i think you want npm publish
20:30 < CoverSlide> i'm not sure if that's what you're saying
20:30 < pandeiro> CoverSlide: no i am not the author or anything, just wanted to upgrade on my own machine
20:31 < pachet> npm update whatever -g
20:31 < pandeiro> pachet: i'm scared that would go try to fetch the most recent version in the npm repo, no?
20:31 < pandeiro> npm install -g seems to have done it
20:32 < CoverSlide> ok wtg! even though i have no idea what you wanted it to do
20:33 < pandeiro> i'm using a utility (underscore-cli) and the version at master has a fix and there's no new version in npm...
20:34 < gildean> pandeiro: you can install from git too
20:35 < pandeiro> gildean: how?
20:35 < pachet> rm -rf that directory
20:35 < pachet> git clone whatever.git
20:35 < pandeiro> pachet: no i just git pull, that works fine
20:36 < gildean> npm install <git remote url>
20:36 < CoverSlide> npm install git+https://github.com/path/to/package
20:36 < gildean> pandeiro: https://npmjs.org/doc/install.html
20:36 < CoverSlide> i think you can also use @ to select specific tags or branches
20:36 < pandeiro> that is cool, didn't know that
20:37 < CoverSlide> er maybe not
20:37 < CoverSlide> dunno, haven't tried it
20:37 < CoverSlide> but I think it defaults to master
20:37 < gildean> CoverSlide: well you can install by commit-ish
20:37 < gildean> at least that what the docs say
20:38 < CoverSlide> ah there it is: <protocol>://[<user>@]<hostname><separator><path>[#<commit-ish>]
20:38 < pandeiro> i see that `npm -l` or `npm help install` were what i needed
20:38 < CoverSlide> the # is the commit separator
20:38 < pandeiro> i remembered reading npm man pages but `man npm` doesn't do it
20:38 < pandeiro> thanks for the overview CoverSlide, gildean 
20:39 < gildean> np
20:40 < BleKohl_> http://shitnodeprogrammerssay.com/
20:43 <@mbalho> is that a joke? i dont get it
20:44 < happyface> mbalho: you must not be an advanced enough node.js developer yet
20:44 < happyface> (I don't get it either)
20:44 < pachet> mbalho: tomorrow the site will read:
20:44 < pachet> "is that a joke? i dont get it" - mbalho
20:45 < happyface> lol
20:55 < merpnderp> require.js has this awesome plugin for passing in text files as a string. Is there any way to do this with browserify?
20:57 < merpnderp> Ah, brfs
20:57 < dypsilon> Hi, doesn anyone know if I can use multiple plugins with one server with hapi?
21:03 < Skaag> I have a small daemon handling some hardware, what's an eary yet reliable way to send a message to a node.js app on the same box, that will reach the user's browser?
21:03 < CoverSlide> eary?
21:03 < Skaag> s/eary/easy/g
21:03 < CoverSlide> like covered with ears?
21:03 < Skaag> :-)
21:03 < Skaag> very funny
21:04 < CoverSlide> http://lindamade.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/ears.jpg
21:04 < CoverSlide> a very eary picture
21:04 < Skaag> LOL!!
21:05 < CoverSlide> Skaag: is the daemon in node too?
21:05 < CoverSlide> because dnode is usually the easiest way to get two node processes to talk to eachother
21:06 < CoverSlide> and use upnode to keep it connected
21:06 < CoverSlide> depending on the complexity of the message
21:07 < CoverSlide> if it's simple, you can just send a USR1 single
21:07 < CoverSlide> *signal
21:10 < Skaag> it's not in node
21:11 < Skaag> I need to communicate a series of messages
21:11 < Skaag> like events
21:13 < CoverSlide> hmm, then some plain socket communication then, over net. you can use unix sockets for it though, provided poth processes are on the same machine
21:14 < Skaag> yep, they are
21:14 < Skaag> yah I like the socket idea
21:30 < sinclair-work> damn, knockout.js is kinda awesome isn't it
21:32 < CoverSlide> it is? news to me
21:43 < GOMADWarrior> how to display images?
21:44 < jesusabdullah> GREAT NEWS EVERYONE https://twitter.com/jesusabdullah/status/322826256162885635
21:44 < frawr> Hi, I tried to build arch but when I run make I get the following error: "NameError: global name 'file' is not difined"
21:44 < frawr> *defined
21:44 < CoverSlide> jesusabdullah: sweet
21:44 < frawr> What might be the cause of this?
21:44 < jesusabdullah> would love some retweets
21:45 < Bioshox> I'm using the Nodejs Native Mongo Driver, the find operation returns an object such as: [ { _id: 51668511febf7857949ef614, term: 'bieber', active: false } ]. How do I iterate over this?
21:46 < Bioshox> I've tried object.keys(items).forEach(key){console.log(key);} but it just retuns 0
21:46 < WeeJeWel> jesusabdullah: that's cool
21:46 < WeeJeWel> the design is just a bit boring imho
21:46 < GOMADWarrior> how to display images?
21:47 < jesusabdullah> WeeJeWel: Yeah maybe, it's a consequence in part of going "academic style"
21:47 < WeeJeWel> xD
21:47 < Bioshox> Got it :')
21:48 < jesusabdullah> WeeJeWel: Doing interesting poster layouts requires inkscape imo, these use latex/beamer
21:49 < GOMADWarrior> I use express?
21:50 < dypsilon> Is there a way to add some kind of namespace to npm packages? For example I want to create a package which is used in my company internally, ideally I would name it something like company::project::package and it would install under node_modules/company/project/package. Does npm have something like that?
21:50 < CoverSlide> GOMADWarrior: use ecstatic
21:51 < frawr> Hi, When running make on node.js I get the error "NameError: global name 'file' is not defined"? Any clue why this might be so?
22:03 < EricKatherman_> Can someone shed some light on what might be causing my stack size exceeded error?  When I run my query on my local node installation, the query returns all the data.  Against my live node server, it doesn't.  My query includes a "rows_per_page" attribute that when set to 1080 or less, the live API does return them, but higher than that and it dies with a stack size exceeded error
22:04 < EricKatherman_> I tried starting node with the --max-stack-size=8000000 but no change
22:15 < samholmes> I'm using validator! It's awesome
22:15 < samholmes> But, how can I check for phone numbers?
22:15 < samholmes> what is a phone number?
22:19 < nykac> hey, how can i specify the 'this' in a http request?
22:20 < gluxon> nykac: Can you elaborate?
22:20 < gluxon> Is something preventing you from using "this"?
22:23 < nykac> well, this gets set to the response object
22:24 < nykac> i'm definig a prototype, and i want it to be able to modify the object it is called on
22:26 < gluxon> nykac: var self = this;
22:27 < gluxon> nykac: Temporarily assign it to another variable. "self" is commonly used with JavaScript.
22:27 < gluxon> This is the recommended method to solve that issue.
22:31 < s3shs> How do I declare a global function programmatically?  I have a function object and I want to assign it to a global, dynamic name.  Would it go in window.functionName or somthing?
22:32 < dypsilon> s3shs, I know it doesn't answer your question, but: please don't do it.
22:33 < s3shs> Everything in moderation.  ;-)  I'm sure you do it all the time when you declare function XYZ() {}.
22:33 < s3shs> I guess my question is, what holds XYZ?
22:34 < dypsilon> I think it's inside module scope.
22:34 < dypsilon> privately
22:35 <@Nexxy> s3shs, use require
22:36 < s3shs> That doesn't help me make a global function.
22:36 < s3shs> ya'll probably don't like gotos in C++ either.
22:36 < dypsilon> i guess you can't make global functions in node without extending v8 or something
22:36 < s3shs> ;-)
22:37 < dypsilon> s3shs, if you like c++ so much, go on and extend v8 and create your gobal function there :)
22:37 < s3shs> Well, I can make them just by declaring them.  As in function XYZ() {}.  Right?  Is that not a global function?
22:37 < dypsilon> it depends on how you define "global"
22:37 < s3shs> How would you define my example?
22:37 < s5fs> depends on what the meaning of "is" is
22:38 < Bioshox> anybody know how i can run multiple twitter streams without making a new req
22:38 < dypsilon> s3shs, your example creates a function in the current scope
22:38 < s3shs> Ok, how do I assign a function to the current scope?  :-)
22:39 < dypsilon> with var
22:39 < dypsilon> or how you just said: function xyz()
22:39 < s3shs> Ok, we're on the same page now, at least.  It's hard explaining things in chats.
22:39 < s3shs> So, say xyz is a variable.  How do I define it?
22:39 < dypsilon> maybe i could help you if you tell me what you are trying to accomplish
22:40 < dypsilon> var xyz
22:40 < dypsilon> sorry, js basics are in #javascript ;)
22:40 < s3shs> Ha ha.
22:41 < s3shs> I have a module.  It exports a function.  But I do some inheritance work on the object first.  I'm trying to coalesce it all to reduce the amount of redundancy in my code.  e.g.: Typing XYZ 3 or 4 times.
22:41 < s3shs> That's all.  I'm not trying to be evil.
22:42 < Guest52800> I built node from the git repo but I don't seem to have node-waf. How can I install it?
22:42 < dypsilon> on which object do you do inheritance work (whatever that means)?
22:42 <@Nexxy> node-waf is deprecated
22:42 <@Nexxy> node-gyp is teh future
22:42 < Guest52800> Ah ok, It is still in the documentation for addons. Thank you
22:42 < Guest52800> node
22:43 < Guest52800> the command node-gyp is not found either :
22:43 < dypsilon> s3shs, I think what you are trying to do is just define your function outside your exports.whatever function so you can reuse inside your exports.whatever
22:43 <@TooTallNate> Guest52800: it's bundled with npm, you usually don't need to invoke it manually
22:44 < s3shs> So I normally do var MyClass = function() {..}.  And then module.exports = MyClass.
22:44 < dypsilon> s3shs, yep
22:44 < s3shs> See, I'm not crazy.
22:44 < dypsilon> s3shs, every crazy persons think that :D
22:44 < s3shs> :-|
22:45 < Guest52800> Ok thank you! http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/addons.html#addons What command would I use to build hello.node in the example for the hello world native addon
22:45 < dypsilon> ok, wasn't nice, sorry, could hold myself back
22:45 < s3shs> So how would I do var MyClass = function() {..}.  And then module.exports = MyClass in one line and typing MyClass once?
22:46 < dypsilon> module.exports = function() {...}
22:46 <@TooTallNate> Guest52800: dude those are the v0.4.12 docs
22:46 <@TooTallNate> Guest52800: that's *ancient*
22:46 < Havvy> Guest1617: change v0.4.12 to v0.10.2
22:46 < Havvy> In the URL
22:47 < s3shs> But, later, when I assign functions to the prototype I do MyClass.prototype.init = function() {...}.  So should I reference the class through module.exports
22:47 < s3shs> ?
22:47 < dypsilon> why not
22:47 < Guest52800> @TooTallNate Haha, I'm new to Node, thanks!
22:47 <@TooTallNate> Guest52800: no worries man! just trying to make sure you're looking at the right set of docs ;)
22:48 < s3shs> Or I could do... var MyClass = module.exports = function() {...}.
22:48 < s3shs> Doh.
22:48 < dypsilon> or that
22:48 < s3shs> I like that better.  All on one line.  Short, sweet, can be referenced by name.
22:48 < s3shs> Which I only have to type once.
22:49 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs master * 17a379e : url: Escape all unwise characters  This makes node's http URL handling lo - http://git.io/e-GpKg
22:49 < s3shs> dypsilon, thanks for your patience and getting me on the right page.
22:49 < dypsilon> s3shs, np, you are welcome
22:51 < Guest52800> @TooTallNate found node-gyp, thank you
23:09 < Industrial> In a _transform, can I emit('data', buf) several times instead of calling cb null, buff once?
23:27 < Bioshox> anybody have any idea if i can use passport-twitter to get an access_token
23:33 < nykac> gluxon: and how do i update the this value? will it just work?
23:34 < gluxon> nykac: Yep.
23:34 < gluxon> nykac: All you have to do is place that in your constructor.
23:35 < gluxon> nykac: It will stay updated throughout your class.

23:40 < antonio`> hello
23:41 < Purefan> Hello everyone. I am getting a "Cannot find module ../../common" when running my app. I added "common" to the dependencies and I see it in the node_modules folder, this is comming from the mysql module, any idea how to fix this?
23:44 < richweskus> i have installed a package called 'http-agent' but when i assign a variable httpAgent=require('http-agent') it comes back saying "Cannot find module 'http-agent'" when i run the nodejs script
23:48 < Industrial> Anyone have an example of a stream.Duplex with _read and _write ?
23:59 < mscdex> richweskus: you did `npm install http-agent` ?
