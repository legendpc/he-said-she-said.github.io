00:00 < ProLoser|Work> um
00:00 <@bnoordhuis> hah, g-wan
00:00 < ProLoser|Work> https://github.com/proloser/learnode.js
00:00 <@bnoordhuis> read the g-wan forums, it's great entertainment
00:00 < ProLoser|Work> 1 hour long end-to-end tutorial on node
00:00 < ProLoser|Work> assumes 0 knowledge, including walking you through how to install everything
00:01 < ProLoser|Work> takes you all the way to having a deployed (and mvc structured) application online
00:01 <@rvagg> ProLoser|Work: you could consider Ender though we're aiming for a more Node-style build process for v1.0, we're not quite there yet. Check out the 1.0-wip branch if you want to poke around, it's in npm as ender@dev
00:01 < dogmatic69> ProLoser|Work: nice
00:01 < ProLoser|Work> woops wrong link: http://vimeo.com/38136668
00:01 < ProLoser|Work> it's a video, the first link is just  my code :)
00:01 < dogmatic69> not bad... "Transaction rate:	     1360.41 trans/sec" 
00:03 < dogmatic69> My first attempt http://paste.ubuntu.com/1122481/
00:04 < dogmatic69> siege -b -c 500 node.dev
00:05 <@AviMarcus> siege?
00:05 < dogmatic69> load thingy
00:05 <@AviMarcus> hmm better than ab apache thing?
00:05 <@Lorentz> some kind of benchmark thingy
00:05 < moxie> poop -x 4 -d 284 node.pickles.js
00:05 < dogmatic69> AviMarcus: never tried ab, siege does all sorts
00:06 <@AviMarcus> dogmatic69, node-mysql doesn't have connection pooling built in
00:06 <@AviMarcus> so if you add a second mysql connection it might queue and return stuff faster
00:07 < dogmatic69> AviMarcus: in my app, make something like var clientfoo = mysql.... in the loop?
00:07 <@AviMarcus> simplest way.. make client1 and client2 and randomly choose one for your write
00:07 <@AviMarcus> OH
00:07 <@AviMarcus> WAIT!
00:07 <@AviMarcus> more the USE test into the connection
00:08 <@AviMarcus> ,database: 'test'
00:08 <@AviMarcus> and retry without any other changes ;)
00:08 <@AviMarcus> s/more/move/
00:09 < dogmatic69> into the connection? you mean inside createServer()
00:10 <@AviMarcus> inside the mysql.createClient({
00:11 <@AviMarcus> if client is a var in the global scope btw you don't need to pass it through your functions
00:11 < Domenic> Has anyone gotten the npm-www site working on Windows? Failing on process.binding('signal_watcher')
00:12 < dogmatic69> AviMarcus: good point about the scope. I was looking at the docs and dont see how you set up use in the createClient. is it as simple as use: 'foobar'
00:13 < dogmatic69> doh, I guess 'database' would be it
00:13 <@AviMarcus> use? it's "database" I thought. or maybe both. Tell me new benchmark please!
00:13 < dogmatic69> one sec.
00:13 <@AviMarcus> <AviMarcus> ,database: 'test'
00:13 < dogmatic69> :/ missed that line completely.
00:17 < dogmatic69> AviMarcus: not much difference http://paste.ubuntu.com/1122496/
00:18 < dogmatic69> slightly higher concurrency, slightly lower trans/s
00:18 <@AviMarcus> are you indexing on ID btw?
00:19 <@AviMarcus> your index might be getting more complicated
00:20 <@AviMarcus> I woulda though it'd be better.
00:20 <@AviMarcus> 'night
00:21 < dogmatic69> id is PRIMARY
00:21 < dogmatic69> truncated before running again
00:22 < dogmatic69> oh, got it much faster on the insert side now with multiple connections
00:23 < dogmatic69> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1122501/
00:23 < dogmatic69> requests are the same, but mysql filling up faster like this
00:28 < rektide> come back npm
00:32 < rektide> miracle of miracles, modules!
00:32 < rektide> oh how i love them
00:33 < TehShrike> ^
00:34 < TehShrike> I'm going through npmjs.org withdrawal already
00:34 <@deoxxa> npm install miracles
00:35 < randomachiever> What is the best way for Node.js to communicate with php?
00:38 <@deoxxa> randomachiever: i'd say in a very condescending tone
00:38 < randomachiever> made me LoL
00:39 <@deoxxa> like "yes, php. that's right. you're a real language too."
00:39 <+Niloc> Don't lie
00:39 < randomachiever> Ha!
00:39 <@slickplaid> best way is not to
00:40 < randomachiever> doexxa I have done some research (googling, StackOverflow) and I cant seem to find any solid information on the topic
00:40 <@slickplaid> you could just use http
00:41 < samholmes> So this is why search.npm.org wasn't working earlier. ;P
00:41 < CoverSlide> child_process.spawn
00:41 < _ritch> randomachiever: stdio is probably the simplest way to do it, though it has side effects and constraints
00:41 < samholmes> Updated to the new npm have we. XD
00:41 < samholmes> Must say, the new search.npmjs.org search is i lacking a bit
00:41 <@slickplaid> or, as CoverSlide says, run a child_process instance of php
00:42 < ovaillancourt> randomachiever: zeromq could be a good option
00:42 < randomachiever> slickplaid, I am very much a novice, wouldnt http tie up threads?
00:44 < luckysmack> what is the benefit of using flatironjs over express or another one of the basic frameworks? what about angular.js?
00:44 <@slickplaid> randomachiever: depends on what you're trying to accomplish
00:45 <@slickplaid> I regularly have to build single sign on/oAuth mechanisms that talk to every language under the sun
00:46 <@slickplaid> using http is a nice way to make it so the language doesn't matter (much)
00:46 < randomachiever> Simplest example would be, check if a User is online, Socket.io > Node.js > ask php if the user's online then back
00:46 <@slickplaid> so you can just http.request() to the other server and exchange your message
00:46 < luckysmack> well i have a few projects i would like to work on. one geared more towards live interaction ala socket.io which is more of a strategy/turn based game. mostly for learning. im not aiming to make it anything special. 
00:47 < zak_> has anybody had any success bootstraping dojo 1.8 into nod?
00:47 < randomachiever> I think I am confused on the process, I am still reading Node.js docs
00:47 < luckysmack> yea having a good rest based api will be very important for my apps. 
00:47 <@AAA_awright> Is Node.js going to upgrade Buffer to Uint16Array?
00:47 < luckysmack> the other i want to do is something for work, mostly highly interactive forms and stats tracking.
00:48 <@slickplaid> brb
00:48 < timeturner> is there something that I can cope paste a library's code into to graphically see the tree structure and how one function is calling another which is calling another etc.?
00:53 < rektide> oh neighborhood barking dog
00:55 < rektide> you sound so hoarse, your cry like that of an existentially horrified once healthy hound, who has been bitten by another zombie dog and in the final clutches of losing your dogmanity
00:55 < rektide> to this i say, fucking give it up, you ill bred mutt
00:57 <@Lorentz> how poetic

01:13 < randomachiever> When creating a new node.js application, what is the ideal path to use?
01:14 <+Niloc> the path of righteousness
01:14 < randomachiever> well said
01:14 <@AvianFlu> the middle path
01:19 < moxie> randomachiever, i take the highway
01:19 < moxie> the very high way
01:20 < randomachiever> I think we all like the very high way
01:21 < moxie> ive done a lot of stuff with node now
01:21 < moxie> I STILL DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT
01:22 <+Niloc> oh my, such anger
01:22  * Niloc hugs moxie
01:22 <+Niloc> guys, moxie here needs a few hugs
01:23 <@maxogden> this channel gets weird
01:24 < moxie> maxogden, ok
01:25 < moxie> randomachiever, make a directory, and a package.json, and then make a bunch of source code
01:26 < moxie> with stuff like #define INT * <html> $_POST[{vars}]++;
01:26 < moxie> the semicolon is very important
01:27 < moxie> dont forget that
01:27 < moxie> because just this " #define INT * <html> $_POST[{vars}]++"  wont work
01:27 < randomachiever> Thanks for the tips
01:27 < moxie> hacker tips!

01:38 <@AAA_awright> Ugh I wish I had the time to write up a detailed document on the semantics of Node.js callbacks, events, packages, modules. A lot of debate on the mailing lists could be adverted if people just knew what a "callback" is.
01:39 < Benvie> https://gist.github.com/3222502 check that out, briding the node module system into appjs browser context
01:42 < DTrejo> AAA_awright: callbackhell?
01:44 < gicode> I wish the APIs didn't use the term "fork" when they aren't using the system call.

02:12 < gblock> yanush: I am here
02:12 < gblock> yanush: but not sure I can help much :-)
02:13 < gblock> yanush: I can say we're investigating it. Martin works at MS so it's affecting some internal teams :-)
02:13 < yanush> gblock: well for me, for now, the silent workaround is sufficient
02:13 < moxie> <maxogden> http://callbackhell.com
02:13 < yanush> gblock: but I wouldn't wanna go with that for long
02:14 < yanush> gblock: i'm going into production on sunday *eeek* so i hope this will be resolved in a month's time, is that an overrated expectation ?
02:15 < gblock> yanush: well I won't say anything until we can identify the cause :-)
02:15 < yanush> gblock: whats the diff between node 0.7.9 and 0.8.0 ?
02:15 < gblock> yanush: ideal would be that there is some small config switch we can make
02:15 < gblock> yanush: well I would go with 0.8.4
02:16 < gblock> yanush: much more stable / bugs worked out
02:16 < yanush> gblock: this problem exists on 0.8.4
02:16 < gblock> yanush: I don't think this is a node issue
02:16 < gblock> yanush: that's just my initial guess
02:16 < gblock> yanush: as we only hit this in Azure
02:16 < gblock> yanush: but….I could be wrong
02:16 < yanush> gblock: its a hybrid issue for sure, since forking worked on azure in version 0.7.9
02:17 < gblock> yanush: as in Node 0.8.0 we found a bug with accessing UNC shares
02:17 < yanush> gblock: i tried several versions around until I found the exact version it stopped working
02:17 < gblock> yanush: which showed up in Azure and appeared to be Azure specific at first
02:17 < gblock> yanush: that's useful info! Can you reply to that on the thread
02:17 < yanush> gblock: on it
02:18 < gblock> sweet
02:18 <@maxogden> isaacs: stream question for ya. im writing a passthrough stream that takes in json objects and emits out csv row strings
02:18 < gblock> I'd make sure the core team knows this
02:19 < gblock> yanush: because it may in fact be a node issue :-)
02:19 <@maxogden> isaacs: my class is called JSONToCSV so i do jsonStream.pipe(new JSONToCSV())
02:19 <@maxogden> isaacs: the constructor doesnt get anything passed to it cause it cant do anything until write is called
02:19 < yanush> gblock: its posted, if there is anything else I can do , please lemme know.
02:19 <@maxogden> isaacs: but what do you think of using the constructor as a middleware thing for network purposes
02:20 <@maxogden> isaacs: so for instance jsonStream.pipe(new JSONToCSV(resp))
02:20 <@maxogden> isaacs: that way if you pass in a server response object the stream can be like 'oh i should set content type and whatever'
02:20 <@maxogden> isaacs: and if you dont it just doesnt do anything
02:20 < gblock> yanush: you've done a lot
02:20 <@maxogden> isaacs: (this is kind of a middleware pattern i guess)
02:20 < gblock> isaacs: can you take a peak at this issue: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3779#issuecomment-7416376
02:21 < yanush> gblock: since my entire startup + life are now based on node.js I guess its just the beginning :P
02:21 < gblock> isaacs: it looks like it is in fact related to node though it appeared to be Azure specific. It only started in 0.8.x
02:21 < gblock> yanush: ha ha! hold on. Great to hear you are using Azure….
02:21 < gblock> yanush: we have a node-azure channel btw…though it's often quiet
02:22 < yanush> gblock: on sunday 10000 request per second will get poured into my app, hope the roof holds :)
02:22 < gblock> lol
02:23 < gblock> shoot me an email, gblock@microsoft.com. Love to hear more about what you are doing.
02:23 < gblock> yanush: don't worry, we've got some really large customers running node right now, that I can't talk about
02:23 < gblock> yanush: in Azure, with literally hundreds of instances
02:23 < gblock> yanush: serving millions of requests
02:24 < yanush> gblock: thats good to hear! :) 
02:24 < gblock> yanush: are you using worker or web role?
02:24 < gblock> yanush: worker right?
02:24 < yanush> worker ye
02:24 < yanush> gblock: started with c9
02:24 < gblock> yanush: is it mostly web api type stuff..or is it also a website?
02:25 < gblock> gblock: sweet
02:25 < gblock> gblock: using the azure deployment?
02:25 < gblock> yanush: those were meant for you
02:25 < gblock> :-)
02:25 < yanush> gblock: i am actually writnig their worker role deployment now
02:25 < gblock> yanush: meaning are you using the azure deployment in C9?
02:25 < yanush> gblock: since they only deploy to web roles
02:25 < gblock> yanush: aaah I have been pushing them do it
02:25 < gblock> yanush: it's not hard
02:25 < gblock> yanush: to take what's there and make it support worker
02:25 < yanush> gblock: I'm in contact with a uy named Jen or Jan 
02:25 < gblock> yanush: great to hear you are doing it
02:26 < gblock> yanush: jan and I worked together to get the web role support in
02:26 < gblock> yanush: he's great…jan jong boom
02:26 < gblock> yanush: it was an awesome syntergy
02:26 < gblock> yanush: synergy
02:26 < yanush> gblock: yea, hopefully I'll get to it in the next few weeks. 
02:26 < gblock> nice!
02:27 < yanush> gblock: about what my system does exactly, I can't really talk about it in this forum (no offense meant to anyone)
02:28 < gblock> yanush: that's why I said email me :-)
02:29 < gblock> yanush: if you like.....
02:29 < yanush> will do 
02:40 < moxie> gblock, dont get raped
02:41 < gblock> moxie: ha ha what are you doing here?
02:41 < gblock> moxie: aren't you a PHP guy?
02:41 < gblock> moxie: is that a problem I should worry about in Shanghai?
02:41 < gblock> moxie: ;-)
02:43 < moxie> gblock, how am i a php guy
02:43 < sridatta> anyone familiar with jade templating here? I want to add an html5 video tag but it doesn't seem to support it afaik
02:44 < moxie> sridatta, no but im familiar with google
02:44 < gblock> moxie: I guess I am just getting senile
02:44 < gblock> moxie: I didn't realize you were using node
02:45 < gblock> moxie: assuming this is the moxie I think it is
02:45 < moxie> derp
02:45 < gblock> sriley: does it need to? jade just writes out any tag no?
02:45 < gblock> sridatta: that was meant for you
02:45 < gblock> sridatta: doesn't jade just write out any html tag? I don't think it has a whitelist does it?
02:46 < sridatta> gblock: I tried the obvious syntax based on the other tags but I get "unexpected reserved word"
02:46 < gblock> sridatta: ok, I guess I am wrong then :-) ask @tjholowaychuk on twitter 
02:48 < moxie> gblock, http://i.imgur.com/Gz9B0.jpg
02:49 < gblock> @moxie that's you?
02:49 < moxie> yes
02:49 < moxie> DAT MUS-TARD
02:49 < gblock> @moxie: I thought you were a completely different @moxie
02:49 < gblock> :-)
02:50 < gblock> I have a friend @moxie on twitter who lives in Norway
02:50 < moxie> eh
02:50 < moxie> THATS MEE
02:51 < gblock> moxie:  are you giving me a hard time?
02:51 < gblock> moxie: ya know what…I am wrong
02:52 < moxie> ohhh hoh ho ooooooooo no you dont
02:52 < moxie> you arent getting out of this one that easily
02:53 < gblock> moxie: watch me :-)
02:53 < moxie> gblock, you mus'nt
02:54 < moxie> im listening to mozart
02:54 < moxie> thinking of you
02:54  * moxie ponders
02:55 < gblock> moxie: so @moxie on twitter is you?
02:56 < moxie> |HELLO
03:00 < WillMarshall> Hey! I'm having a weird little issue between two Node apps
03:00 < WillMarshall> Both are "brunch" seeds, one for Ember.js and one for Angular.js
03:00 < WillMarshall> They both include a package called jade-brunch
03:00 < WillMarshall> However, one of my projects is missing files in the jade-brunch package that the other has
03:00 < WillMarshall> I can't work out why
03:01 < moxie> <maxogden> http://callbackhell.com
03:01 < WillMarshall> Specifically, my jade-brunch folder in the Ember project is missing node_modules/jade-brunch/node_modules/jade
03:02 < Domenic> WillMarshall: it's possible npm is smart enough to not install duplicates, and instead it looks for jade higher up in the hierarcy
03:02 < gblock> moxie: I was confused. I have a friend who works here: http://www.moxiesoft.com/ and for some reason that is where I got  moxie. My other friend is not @moxie on twitter. :-)
03:03 < WillMarshall> Domenic: Both have identical lists of packages in ./package.json is the issue
03:03 < WillMarshall> Except for the ember/angular split
03:03 < Domenic> WillMarshall: it doesn't matter, npm wouldn't install duplicates, it would just look for jade higher up in the hierarchy.
03:03 < WillMarshall> Domenic: Interesting
03:04 < WillMarshall> The reason I ask is because launching my server is giving me this: https://gist.github.com/3223257
03:04 < WillMarshall> On the Ember project with the missing dir
03:04 < Domenic> WillMarshall: I'd fix the EADDRINUSE first
03:05 < Domenic> WillMarshall: otherwise it could be that brunch_JavaScriptCompiler_runtime.js is buggy and does not deal well with this situation.
03:05 < WillMarshall> Domenic: Done, but the Jade failure is still there
03:05 < WillMarshall> Hmm
03:05 < mhike0626> hello
03:06 < Domenic> WillMarshall: I'd open a bug with the author of that file. He/she is not handling a legitimate installation structure generated by npm, it seems. E.g. he/she should use `require.resolve("jade/runtime")` instead of `path.resolve("node_modules/jade/runtime.js")`
03:07 < WillMarshall> Domenic: The file doesn't even seem to exist
03:07 < WillMarshall> Which is … odd
03:08 < Domenic> WillMarshall: doesn't it exist in another place in the folder structure? some other node_modules directory?
03:08 < WillMarshall> Domenic: Neither of my apps contains a file or a string matching "brunch_JavaScriptCompiler_runtime"
03:09 < Domenic> WillMarshall: err, that's wierd. I guess brunch or jade-brunch or whatever is generating it?
03:09 < WillMarshall> I'd assume so, yeah
03:09 < Domenic> Icky
03:09 < WillMarshall> I dont' really understand the Node stack, which doesn't help
03:10 < Domenic> Well this is a problem with the brunch stack really
03:10 < Domenic> It's doing crazy things
03:10 < Domenic> If you want to understand the node module system, and node_modules, and the like, start with this: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html
03:10 < WillMarshall> Well, part of the issue is that I'm not really trying to learn Node right now :/
03:10 < WillMarshall> I just want Brunch to work properly so I can do a client-side project
03:11 < Domenic> Yeah, but Brunch is a pretty untested and immature framework, so that wasn't a great choice :-/
03:12 < Domenic> Plus, it's written by a racist, so there's that.
03:12 < WillMarshall> Ah
03:12 < WillMarshall> Links?
03:12 < WillMarshall> I didn't pick it, but I haven't committed to it yet
03:12 < WillMarshall> Is there something more mature and less racist?
03:13 < WillMarshall> npm rebuild fixed it, incidentally
03:13 < Domenic> Oh, nice!!
03:14 < WillMarshall> I think. Hmm.
03:14 < WillMarshall> Might just be that I removed a package
03:14 < Domenic> This might be a good place to learn about frameworks: http://todomvc.com/
03:15 < WillMarshall> Nah, it was just the removal of the jade-brunch package that "fixed" it
03:15 < moxie> LoL
03:16 < WillMarshall> Manually copying the missing part of the package across also fixes it, but that isn't exactly a nice fix
03:17 < Domenic> As for paulmillr's racist-ness, I think jashkenas was able to get GitHub to delete the actual pull request where things got really ugly, but here's a sampling: https://github.com/paulmillr/coffee-script/commit/443012b5b2bb8fac64abfb9fc06f9cfe98e4ae0e
03:17 < Domenic> (note the branch name also)
03:18 < WillMarshall> Domenic: Thanks for that
03:19 < WillMarshall> What the fuck's up with the english on that?
03:19 < jrajav> WillMarshall: Take a look at the lexer.js diff
03:19 < jrajav> second from the top
03:20 < WillMarshall> Right. So he has a "nigga" branch with a bunch of bad English aliases in it
03:20 < WillMarshall> What a cunt
03:21 < WillMarshall> I assume he's not invited to any more Node.js conferences?
03:30 < DTrejo> who thinks it would be fun to participate in a npm+node contribution hackathon?
03:31 < samholmes> Browserify can make it difficult to develop and debug client-side code because it's all in one file. How can this problem be solved?
03:32 < Domenic> samholmes: here is a solution I hacked together for our project, but it is not really modular enough yet to be easily reusable. https://github.com/NobleJS/WinningJS-build/blob/master/lib/doBrowserify.js
03:32 < samholmes> Maybe with a browserify "development mode" where the bundle loads the individual scripts separately, instead of all compiled together.
03:33 < Domenic> samholmes: there is also https://github.com/substack/wreq but I don't think it's used very much at all, so I bet it falls down on a lot of edge cases
03:34 < samholmes> Domenic: interesting.
03:35 < samholmes> I'd vote for a dev mode for browserify, that way I can just turn it on and off between dev and production environments.
03:35 <@SubStack> --debug
03:35 < samholmes> SubStack: Hmm. Does that load files separately?
03:35 < Domenic> samholmes: the problem is then you have to rewrite your index.html so it uses lots of <script> tags instead of just one
03:36 < samholmes> Domenic: Not really. You could make the single script file dynamically load in the scripts.
03:36 < Domenic> samholmes: ok, that is more like wreq then
03:36 < samholmes> Domenic: with wreq, you have to write the script tags individually.
03:36 < samholmes> What I'm saying is, you could have the initial script do this work.
03:37 < Domenic> samholmes: I don't believe so, you just do <script src="/js/entry.js" type="text/wreq"> and all the rest get loaded dynamically
03:37 < samholmes> Domenic: According to the README, you have to write the script tags and give them each an attribute type='text/wreq'
03:38 < Domenic> samholmes: just entry.js
03:38 < Domenic> or any other "starting" modules
03:38 < samholmes> Domenic: Ah I see.
03:38 < Domenic> e.g. beep.js and boop.js aren't there
03:38 < samholmes> My bad.
03:39 < samholmes> SubStack: Does browserify do exactly what wreq does in --debug mode?
03:44 <@SubStack> samholmes: no
04:08 <@Raynos> Are there any alternatives to forever for node based monitoring
04:09 <@Raynos> samholmes: use browserifyies --debug flag
04:09 < Domenic> Raynos: upstart?
04:09 <@Raynos> Domenic: joyent says use SMF
04:09 <@mscdex> upstart ftw
04:10 <@Raynos> It needs to work on mac linux & smartos
04:10 < Domenic> Raynos: SMF?
04:10 <@Raynos> Domenic: http://wiki.joyent.com/display/smart/About+the+Service+Management+Facility
04:13 <@Raynos> isaacs: how do I npm search tag & github watchers > 50
04:13 <@Nexxy> upstart doesn't really do monitoring
04:19 <@mscdex> upstartttttttttttttt!!!
04:19 <@Nexxy> mscdex, what happens when your app is still running but not serving requests?
04:19 <@Nexxy> how does upstart fix that?
04:20 <@mscdex> you can set it so that upstart examines your app's bit bucket at a defined interval
04:21 < Domenic> I mean, it's not like forever takes care of that case either. (Right?)
04:21 <@Nexxy> mscdex, bit bucket?
04:21 <@mscdex> lol
04:21 <@Nexxy> well that's why I was recommending upstart + monit
04:21 <@Nexxy> but if upstart does the basic checks monit does then maybe I don't need it
04:21 <@mscdex> Nexxy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_bucket
04:21 <@Nexxy> I just wasn't aware of that capability
04:22 <@Nexxy> OH THANKS, A WIKIPEDIA LINK
04:22 <@mscdex> yw
04:29 < _d4rklit3> ih
04:29 < _d4rklit3> hi
04:29 < _d4rklit3> im tryin to set up a local instance running express to simply serve an html file
04:31 <@maxogden> someone wanna help me out with a file encoding question? when uploading with curl (using --data-binary) to node and then piping it directly to a fs.createWriteStream i get an exact duplicate of my original file:
04:31 <@maxogden> http://max.ic.ht/dropbox/bucket/shapefile-filereader.zip
04:32 <@maxogden> but when i use HTML5 filereader to upload the file I get this o/
04:32 <@maxogden> oh wait original file is: http://max.ic.ht/dropbox/bucket/curl-filereader.zip
04:32 <@maxogden> shapefile-filereader.zip is 659kb, curl-filereader.zip (original) is 346kb
04:33 <@maxogden> i've tried HTML5 filereader readAsBinary and readAsArrayBuffer
04:33 <@maxogden> i'm thinking maybe the encoding is getting set wrong in the browser? can anyone tell me what encoding shapefile-filereader.zip is?
04:38 < wltsmrz> Did you try readAsBinaryString
04:38 < _d4rklit3> anyone around?
04:38 < _d4rklit3> they dont really make it easy to get started with node do they
04:38 < wltsmrz> They most certainly do
04:39 < wltsmrz> What trouble are you having
04:39 < tjholowaychuk> _d4rklit3 start with node itself not express
04:39 < _d4rklit3> well im tryin to get to just making my app
04:39 < _d4rklit3> but i want a node based build system
04:39 < _d4rklit3> im thinkin i may as well run my app from a node.js server that way if i want to deploy it will be easy to just push it to a heroku instance
04:40 <@prettyrobots> maxogden: A zip file has no encoding?
04:40 <@prettyrobots> It's pretty easy to get started with node.
04:41 < _d4rklit3> well i got the server runing, and i can serve my files
04:42 < _d4rklit3> but i want to write in coffee
04:42 <@maxogden> well theres your problem
04:42 < tjholowaychuk> hahahaha i was juuust going to say that
04:42 < _d4rklit3> pff
04:42 < _d4rklit3> i like coffee inheitence
04:42 < _d4rklit3> more like im used to
04:43 < Domenic> maxogden: we had a similar problem once that turned out to be because we weren't pausing/resuming the incoming stream before piping it... the browser sent data events slow enough that the first part of the file got dropped, whereas curl sent them fast enough that all got through and got piped
04:43 <@prettyrobots> _d4rklit3: Try #coffeescript. Here you will only get fisheads and sawdust.
04:43 <@prettyrobots> Domenic: Wow. Awesome.
04:43 < _d4rklit3> well the thing is, im tryin to figure out browserify
04:43 <@maxogden> Domenic: haha
04:43 < _d4rklit3> but before that, i need to learn how node works
04:44 < _d4rklit3> and then how to create a build system in that environment
04:44 <@maxogden> Domenic: im definitely not running into that, but that is awesome
04:44 <@prettyrobots> It's amazing how much stuff I learn and file away from peeking at #node.js.
04:44 < Domenic> Glad everyone liked my story ^_^
04:45 < wltsmrz> Suppose I still don't see what is prohibitively difficult, _d4rklit3 
04:45 < _d4rklit3> don't know where to begin :P
04:45 < _d4rklit3> but i have a node server running, so thats a start
04:46 < wltsmrz> Do you know javascript?
04:46 <@prettyrobots> maxogden: Can you do a binary diff and see how much the files have changed.
04:46 < _d4rklit3> lol yes
04:46 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: one renders utf8 characters in terminal and the other just has black diamonds with question marks in it all over the place instead
04:46 < _d4rklit3> so like i can just write whatever i want in this file
04:46 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: (the two files are linked above if you are interested)
04:46 < _d4rklit3> app.js
04:46 < _d4rklit3> like import some other js file
04:46 < _d4rklit3> and run code 
04:47 <@prettyrobots> Which is original?
04:47 < _d4rklit3> wltsmrz, thanks for that comment
04:47 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: curl
04:47 < _d4rklit3> i do know javascript, thats the key here.
04:47 <@prettyrobots> {"error":"not_found","reason":"Document is missing attachment"}
04:47 <@prettyrobots> http://max.ic.ht/dropbox/bucket/curl-filereader.zip
04:47 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: one sec
04:47 < wltsmrz> Attach things-to-be-exported to module.exports and then you can require() 
04:47 <@maxogden> http://max.ic.ht/dropbox/bucket/shapefile-filereader.zip
04:47 <@maxogden> http://max.ic.ht/dropbox/bucket/shapefile-curl.zip
04:49 <@prettyrobots> maxogden: I are confuse.
04:49 <@prettyrobots> What are you trying to upload exactly? The ZIP file, or one of the files in the zip file.
04:49 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: the entire zip file
04:49 <@prettyrobots> Also, I can't seem to download http://max.ic.ht/dropbox/bucket/shapefile-filereader.zip.
04:49 <@prettyrobots> Curl is the original? It unzips.
04:49 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: yea
04:50 <@prettyrobots> I can't even download filereader.
04:50 <@mscdex> did the behavior of the search functionality on the new npm website change or am I imagining things?
04:50 <@chilts> it uses google search apparently
04:50 <@prettyrobots> I got it with curl.
04:50 < _d4rklit3> when i   npm install -g (windows) where do the bins go?
04:50 <@prettyrobots> MD5 (shapefile-filereader.zip) = d4edd83afb6abf575bf2345f98e6f3a6
04:50 <@mscdex> yeah, i thought it didn't use google earlier today...
04:51 <@rvagg> maybe you should just pay transloadit to take away your pain maxogden
04:51 <@prettyrobots> Is that correct?
04:51 <@mscdex> the google search is pretty bad for finding relevant results
04:51 <@mscdex> like searching for "git"
04:52 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: yea
04:53 <@SomeoneWeird> _d4rklit3, /usr/local/lib/node_modules/
04:54 < _d4rklit3> i found it in my roaming appdata
04:54 < _d4rklit3> in windows, SomeoneWeird 
04:54 <@SomeoneWeird> ah
04:54 <@prettyrobots> maxogden: The contents of the uploaded zip is JSON.
04:54 <@prettyrobots> It is a 64 byte file.
04:55 <@prettyrobots> Are you sure that is the file that gets uploaded?
04:56 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: shapefile-filereader.zip should be a half meg binary file
04:56 <@prettyrobots> Okay. But, when I download from dropbox I only get a dropbox error message.
04:56 <@prettyrobots> Can you put that second file on dropbox again please?
04:57 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: curl "http://max.ic.ht/dropbox/bucket/shapefile-filereader.zip"
04:57 <@maxogden> (works on my end)
04:59 < _d4rklit3> best way to debug in node?
05:00 <@SomeoneWeird> node -debug file.js
05:00 <@SomeoneWeird> + lots of console.logs :P
05:01 < _d4rklit3> does that make them go to client console?
05:01 < _d4rklit3> i would like that
05:01 <@prettyrobots> All of the ASCII strings are the same.
05:01 <@SomeoneWeird> console.log does
05:01 < _d4rklit3> unrecognized flag
05:01 <@prettyrobots> strings shapefile-filereader.zip == strings shapefile-curl.zip
05:02 <@SomeoneWeird> ignore that then
05:02 <@SomeoneWeird> just console.log stuff
05:02 < _d4rklit3> for now
05:02 < _d4rklit3> i would like to see/explore objects tho
05:02 <@SomeoneWeird> yeah
05:02 <@prettyrobots> [ "$(strings shapefile-filereader.zip)" == "$(strings shapefile-curl.zip )" ] && echo woot
05:02 <@SomeoneWeird> console.log(object);
05:02 < cainus> anyone know if net.Server has a 'data' event?  I assume it must, but the docs at http://nodemanual.org/latest/nodejs_ref_guide/net.html#net.createServer don't say a peep about it, or show it in the example...
05:03 < _d4rklit3> do i have to do operations on a request?
05:03 < _d4rklit3> that can't be right
05:04 < _d4rklit3> in app.js i have var browserify = require('browserify'); console.log(browserify)
05:04 < _d4rklit3> i dont see it anywhere
05:04 < tjholowaychuk> in your terminal?
05:05 < _d4rklit3> needed to be inside of the createServer callback
05:05 <@prettyrobots> maxogden: UTF-8
05:05 <@mscdex> cainus: no, the socket objects emit 'data' events
05:05 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: ahh i just figured it out
05:06 < _d4rklit3> ok cool, no browserify tho, undefined
05:06 <@prettyrobots> DId you decode it yet?
05:06 < cainus> mscdex: how does a server read what the socket sends though?
05:06 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: XHR in browsers by default uses 16 bit strings
05:06 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: http://javascript0.org/wiki/Portable_sendAsBinary
05:06 <@prettyrobots> Hmm...
05:06 <@mscdex> cainus: a socket also emits an 'end' event when it receives a TCP FIN
05:06 < wltsmrz> Unable to duplicate your findings, _d4rklit3 
05:06 < cainus> mscdex: ahh I get it.... it gets a client obj from the connect handler
05:07 < cainus> and listens to events on that
05:07 < cainus> alright very cool...thanks
05:07 < _d4rklit3> sorry, i fixed
05:07 <@prettyrobots> maxogden: https://gist.github.com/3223869
05:07 < _d4rklit3> something silly
05:08 < _d4rklit3> you guys ever use node-codein
05:08 <@prettyrobots> maxogden: That's what I did so's to be able to unzip that shapefile.
05:08 <@prettyrobots> Worked.
05:08 <@prettyrobots> FYI.
05:08 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: whoa nice
05:09 <@maxogden> prettyrobots: i could either polyfill the browser to do that before it uploads or do it in node after it uploads.... hmmm....
05:09 < Domenic> maxogden: there's no way to make the browser send binary?
05:10 <@mscdex> anyone know of any actively maintained libgit bindings?
05:10 < Domenic> XHR2 lets you .send() an ArrayBuffer or a Blob I think
05:10 <@maxogden> yea except it uses 16 bit strings
05:10 < Domenic> Why would it send as strings if it's sending binary data... -_-
05:10 <@maxogden> because browsers hate all things holy
05:10 <@Nexxy> no wonder I love them so much
05:11 <@maxogden> Domenic: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35705
05:11 < wltsmrz> You can send binary over websocket no problem
05:11 < _d4rklit3> how does node js handle inheritence?
05:11 <@Nexxy> has anyone done a node/canvas "doodle" app
05:11 < _d4rklit3> same as js ?
05:11 < Domenic> It looks like blobs have content types (and thus encodings), but maybe ArrayBuffers don't?
05:12 <@Nexxy> I need to do signature capture and save the image :D
05:12 < Domenic> maxogden: you've seen http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/#toc-send-arraybuffer ?
05:13 < wltsmrz> Yes, _d4rklit3 
05:13 < wltsmrz> There's also util.inherits http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor
05:14 < cainus> anyone know a good package for crc32 checksums? 
05:14 <@maxogden> Domenic: yea thats basically waht i'm doing
05:14 < tjholowaychuk> cainus "crc"
05:14 <@maxogden> Domenic: the stupid thing is that you have to manually flip the bits around on files
05:15 < Domenic> maxogden: so wierd, stupid browsers :(. It'd be nice if XHR2 just did what you'd think it does.
05:15 < cainus> tj: thanks
05:16 < thealphanerd> Nexxy: I'm working on something similar
05:16 < cainus> wow npmjs.org hates me
05:16 <@Nexxy> thealphanerd, O rly? 
05:16 <@Nexxy> let's talk
05:16 < thealphanerd> http://automagicmusicmaker.com/
05:16 < thealphanerd> but my gui stuff is all open source
05:16 < thealphanerd> and soon to be accessible
05:16 < thealphanerd> what to mix it with node for midi / osc
05:16 <@Nexxy> woah
05:16 < wltsmrz> Where have I seen an almost identical design, thealphanerd?
05:16 <@Nexxy> same layout as WAAA
05:17 < wltsmrz> Must be "WAAA" then
05:17 < thealphanerd> it's github pages theme
05:17 <@Nexxy> ohh that'd be it
05:17 < thealphanerd> http://pages.github.com/
05:17 < wltsmrz> Aha
05:17 <@Nexxy> thealphanerd, neat!
05:17 < thealphanerd> I'm using a framework called infusion
05:18 < thealphanerd> http://fluidproject.org/
05:18 < thealphanerd> Nexxy: what did you want to do?
05:18 < wltsmrz> How does it compare to SoundManager2
05:19 < wltsmrz> I'm not sure if they do the same things or if they are even in the same league
05:19 < thealphanerd> oh infusion is a framework for structuring the code base
05:19 <@Nexxy> I just want to save canvas bitmap data
05:19 < thealphanerd> Nexxy: everything in mine is svg
05:19 < thealphanerd> except dat.gui…. but that's a band aid
05:19 < wltsmrz> getImageData() ?
05:20 < wltsmrz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/CanvasRenderingContext2D#getImageData()
05:20 <@Nexxy> lol ya I'm looking through the mdn right now
05:20 < thealphanerd> https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking
05:20 <@Nexxy> I as just wondering if anyone had something functional I could pick apart
05:20 < thealphanerd> this is what I'm using for dsp
05:20 <@Nexxy> wltsmrz, thanks
05:20 < wltsmrz> Thanks for that, thealphanerd. I had half a mind to work on something similar. 
05:21 < thealphanerd> its really interesting territory
05:21 < thealphanerd> the automagicmusicmaker is a GSOC
05:21 <@SomeoneWeird> does node build on arm?
05:21 < thealphanerd> SomeoneWeird: yes it does
05:21 < thealphanerd> which soc?
05:22 <@SomeoneWeird> soc?
05:22 < tjholowaychuk> Nexxy there's also toDataURL() that might be more useful than the ImageData
05:22 < thealphanerd> which device?
05:22 <@SomeoneWeird> xoom
05:22 <@Nexxy> tjholowaychuk, oki, thanks :)
05:23 < thealphanerd> SomeoneWeird: what OS is it running?
05:23 <@SomeoneWeird> jallybean
05:23 < Domenic> Nexxy indeed toDataURL() is damn useful, highly recommended.
05:23 <@SomeoneWeird> derp, jellybean
05:23 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
05:23 <@SomeoneWeird> so android
05:23 <@Nexxy> well, I'm making a signature capture pad
05:23 <@Nexxy> so I think I want an actual image
05:23 < thealphanerd> is it rooted?
05:23 < tjholowaychuk> Nexxy in that case
05:24 < tjholowaychuk> http://www.wacomeng.com/web/index.html
05:24 < tjholowaychuk> might also be useful
05:24 < merc_> Can you please tell me the IRC room for express?
05:24 <@Nexxy> ooh
05:24 < DTrejo> #expressjs
05:24 < tjholowaychuk> merc_ #express
05:24 < DTrejo> maybe
05:24 < thealphanerd> http://mitchtech.net/node-js-on-android-linux/
05:24 <@Nexxy> people actually respond to questions in #express now?
05:24 < tjholowaychuk> Nexxy it's slick you get the pressure / tilt
05:24 <@Nexxy> tjholowaychuk, well this is just like
05:24 < merc_> TX
05:24 <@Nexxy> a touch screen monitor
05:25 < merc_> The home page for express is dead, would like to tell them
05:25 <@SomeoneWeird> ofc thealphanerd 
05:25 < tjholowaychuk> ah
05:25 <@Nexxy> tjholowaychuk, I've been building a POS
05:25 < _d4rklit3> is there a node.js debug console inspector?
05:25 <@Nexxy> so I'm adding signature capture to it and I want to do it directly on the web app
05:25 <@Nexxy> without the need for additional hardware
05:25 < thealphanerd> _d4rklit3: have you tried running your js through jshint?
05:25 < _d4rklit3> https://github.com/ketamynx/node-codein   i feel like im missing something
05:26 < _d4rklit3> this codein thing looks cool
05:26 < wltsmrz> Doodling smoothly in canvas requires a few things then
05:26 < wltsmrz> ctx.lineJoin = 'round'; ctx.lineCap = 'round'; 
05:26 <@Nexxy> I'm just going to push a bunch of coordinates into an array or something
05:27 < wltsmrz> And instead of ctx.lineTo use ctx.quadraticCurveTo
05:27 <@Nexxy> wltsmrz, good to know ^-^
05:27 < Domenic> wltsmrz these are good tips, thank you, will use for work project
05:29 < tjholowaychuk> there are some good smooth plugins out there too
05:29 < tjholowaychuk> i forget the names
05:29 < tjholowaychuk> for ditching points
05:31 < tjholowaychuk> http://osuushi.github.com/plotdemo016.html
05:31 < tjholowaychuk> not the same one i used
05:31 < tjholowaychuk> but looks like the same idea
05:34 < wltsmrz> http://jsfiddle.net/kQEHz/
05:39 < Thomas_> Hi, I need a variable for document name. Like from inside the file app.js it will be a string "apps.js"
05:41 < wltsmrz> "__filename" works in linux at least
05:41 <@prettyrobots> wltsmrz: Works everywhere.
05:42 < wltsmrz> Has it always?
05:42 <@prettyrobots> Once of the nices things about Node.js; __filename and __dirname.
05:42 <@prettyrobots> wltsmrz: Uh, always is an awfully long time.
05:43 <@prettyrobots> wltsmrz: It's been there for me the whole time I've worked with node.
05:43 < zak_> it works always, except when it doesn't
05:43 <@prettyrobots> Granted, that's only been since 0.2.
05:43 < Thomas_> Thanks every1
05:43 < wltsmrz> It might have been my error, but a few subversions ago it wouldn't work for me.
05:43 < wltsmrz> I'm downgrading now to test.
05:46 < whiskers85> Er.. how do I change my nick to whiskers75?

05:52 <@whiskers75> monad: what's your favourite IDE?
05:52 <@SubStack> but there could be some option I overlooked for sending multiple chunks
05:52 <@monad> I don’t code.
05:52 < wltsmrz> That's funny right there

05:52 <@whiskers75> monad: then why are you in 'Node.js'? :)
05:53 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: if you dont pipe filereader files in browser through that your data will get effed up
05:53 <@monad> whiskers75: I do contract developers to write software
05:53 <@wookiehangover> maxogden: interesting
05:53 <@SomeoneWeird> hmmm
05:54 <@SomeoneWeird> what does the node license allow me todo/not todo?
05:54 <@wookiehangover> maxogden: can't you just use BlobBuilder?
05:54 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: maybe
05:54 <@SubStack> monad: projects still get built that way?
05:54 -!- whiskers75 changed the topic of #Node.js to: The Official Node Javascript Support IRC Channel - http://nodejs.org/
05:54 <@SubStack> :p
05:54 <@monad> some :P

05:55 <@SubStack> I can pretty much only do bottom-up programming
05:56 <@SubStack> I don't even know how to do the other kind where there is a spec and you write code to implement it
05:56 <@monad> SubStack: what were the sentiments behind your queston though?
05:56 <@SubStack> it's like somebody talking japanese at me
05:56 <@SomeoneWeird> <SubStack> I don't even know how to do the other kind where there is a spec and you write code to implement it < +1
05:56 <@whiskers75> My coding regime: guess, google, fix
05:56 <@SubStack> monad: seems waterfallesque is all, thought people mostly knew better by now!
05:57 <@SubStack> I guess if they are small projects that can work out
05:57 <@monad> yeah
05:58 <@wookiehangover> maxogden: actually, scratch that--apparently BlobBuilder has been deprecated in favor of the Blob constructor
06:00 <@whiskers75> I'm having a problem: I need to get this string ('test string\n') to this 'test string'. Here is a gist - code around line 29 https://gist.github.com/3209159
06:00 <@wookiehangover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Blob
06:01 <@SomeoneWeird> lol whiskers75 
06:01 <@whiskers75> why is it a LOL? :)
06:01 <@tuhoojabotti> lot's of love
06:01 <@SomeoneWeird> ;)
06:01 < zak_> can't you just use trim()?
06:01 <@whiskers75> I've tried that, zak_.
06:02 <@whiskers75> If you try line 29 in a Node shell, it works...
06:02 <@SomeoneWeird> its a problem with the code, because the line i gave you works
06:02 <@SomeoneWeird> yeah
06:02 <@whiskers75> line 29 should do it
06:02 <@ljharb> whiskers75: why not just foo.trim('\n') ?
06:02 <@whiskers75> i dont want brackets either
06:02 <@SomeoneWeird> he wants to rid (' and \n')
06:02 <@ljharb> ah
06:03 <@whiskers75> i dont mind ' and '
06:03 <@whiskers75> just NO NEWLINES/BRACKETS
06:03 < zak_> have you taken a look at underscorejs?
06:03 <@whiskers75> but I like Node!
06:03 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
06:04 <@SomeoneWeird> it is node
06:04 <@whiskers75> oh a module?
06:04 <@SomeoneWeird> ya
06:04 < zak_> whiskers75: http://epeli.github.com/underscore.string/

06:06 <@ljharb> whiskers75: how about you console.log `cmd` *before* the replacement, and make sure it's exactly what you expect?
06:06 <@whiskers75> ok, I got underscore.string
06:07 <@whiskers75> ljharb: ok
06:08 <@whiskers75> yep it is
06:08 <@ljharb> whats the output?
06:08 <@whiskers75> (login
06:08 <@whiskers75> )
06:08 <@whiskers75> (login
06:08 <@whiskers75> )
06:09 <@whiskers75> that
06:09 <@whiskers75> i typed login
06:09 <@SomeoneWeird> whyd it get echo'd twice then?
06:09 <@whiskers75> i did a log before and after the replacement
06:09 <@SomeoneWeird> ah
06:09 <@SomeoneWeird> try
06:10 <@SomeoneWeird> cmd = cmd.replace("\r\n)","").replace("(","");
06:10 <@ljharb> ah yes, it's probably stupid windows line endings
06:10 <@SomeoneWeird> yeah
06:10 <@whiskers75> I'll have you know I'm using Ubuntu!
06:10 <@ljharb> probably would have shown up if you'd console logged the JSON.stringify version
06:10 <@ljharb> yes but your users might not be :-p
06:11 <@SomeoneWeird>  whiskers75 try my line ^
06:11 <@whiskers75> ok
06:11 <@whiskers75> fine
06:11 <@SomeoneWeird> unix linebreaks are \r\n
06:11 <@ljharb> what? no they most certainly are not
06:11 <@whiskers75> no dice
06:11 <@SomeoneWeird> aren't they? 
06:11 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
06:11 <@ljharb> windows is the only OS that uses \r afaik
06:11 <@SomeoneWeird> oh
06:11 <@SomeoneWeird> yeah
06:12  * SomeoneWeird got wrong way around
06:12 < zak_> just use a string library so its clear what you're doing
06:12 < zak_> stop re-inventing the wheel
06:12 <@whiskers75> string library?
06:12 <@ljharb> zak_++
06:12 <@whiskers75> help me here
06:12 < zak_> http://epeli.github.com/underscore.string/
06:13 <@whiskers75> ive got that. now what?
06:13 < zak_> here's the doco: http://epeli.github.com/underscore.string/
06:13 < zak_> i'm looking for the best functions
06:13 <@whiskers75> ok
06:14 < ashnur> lol
06:14 < ashnur> so what was that
06:14 < zak_> I would use trim first to get rid of the "whitespaces"
06:15 <@whiskers75> o....k.....?
06:15 < zak_> then i would just use a javascript replace
06:15 <@whiskers75> how>
06:15 <@whiskers75> ?
06:15 <@SomeoneWeird> zak_, like i've been saying..
06:15 <@whiskers75> REPLACES DONT SEEM TO WORK
06:15 < wltsmrz> Do all of these strings follow the same pattern? '(somn\r\n)'
06:15 < zak_> i said use trim.. then replace
06:16 < zak_> it looks like the previous example used replace twice
06:16 <@whiskers75> They're all coming from a REPL through a socket, so yes
06:16 < wltsmrz> Just wondering why not .substring
06:16 < wltsmrz> http://jsperf.com/substringvsreplace-d
06:17 <@whiskers75> Does the code work for anyone else? Run it, then telnet to localhost port 5001
06:18 < zak_> this is a perfect example of something you should write tests for
06:18 <@ljharb> whiskers75: please try console.logging JSON.stringify(cmd) instead. whats *that* output
06:18 <@whiskers75> ok
06:19 <@whiskers75> let me try.....
06:19 < zak_> nobody wants to run your entire application just to test simple string manipulation
06:20 <@whiskers75> That output, interestingly, is "login\n)"
06:20 <@ljharb> so thats why youre replace isn't working.
06:21 <@whiskers75> why?
06:21 <@ljharb> well for one, your replace requires the single quote to be present.
06:22 <@whiskers75> oh
06:22 <@ljharb> as zak_ said, a good reason to have a separate method for sanitizing the command, and unit testing that method.
06:22 <@whiskers75> so what should the replace me?
06:22 <@whiskers75> be
06:22 <@whiskers75> *
06:22 < _d4rklit3> how do import a prototype from an external file in node?
06:22 <@ljharb> your replace has "\n')" when it should have "\n)"
06:23 <@ljharb> also whiskers75, your indentation is inconsistent. also you omit curly braces on single line if statements.
06:25 <@whiskers75> er... ok...
06:25 <@Nexxy> whiskers75, don't mind ljharb he's a whiner
06:25 <@Nexxy> he likes to whine about things
06:26 <@ljharb> i may be a whiner but you should still mind me :-p
06:26 < _d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/4369796
06:26 < _d4rklit3> am i doing this right?
06:26 <@Nexxy> I never do, and look at me!
06:26 < zak_> i like whining about whiners :)
06:26 <@whiskers75> :)
06:26 < _d4rklit3> feels weird ahe to get an prototype instance with var builder = build.builder()
06:26  * zak_ puts on his hypocritical hat
06:26 <@ljharb> Nexxy: i bet your code is properly indented without me saying anything :-p
06:26 < _d4rklit3> i want to be able to var builder = new Builder();
06:26 <@Nexxy> ljharb, well I use hard tabs so probably not
06:27 <@whiskers75> I solved it-ish!
06:27 <@ljharb> _d4rklit3: why not just set module.exports to "Builder"?
06:27 <@ljharb> Nexxy: by "hard tabs" you mean spaces, or \t?
06:27 <@whiskers75> I've now got "login"
06:27 <@Nexxy> \t
06:27 < zak_> code identation is only important in a few languages like Python or COBOL
06:27 <@Nexxy> wait
06:27 <@Nexxy> that's soft isn't it
06:27 < _d4rklit3> like in the require?
06:27 <@ljharb> Nexxy: YES THAT IS THE CORRECT CHARACTER
06:27 <@whiskers75> can I change the "s to 's?
06:27 <@Nexxy> OH MY GOD WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON
06:27 <@ljharb> zak_: code indentation is only *significant* in those languages. it's important in *every* langauge.
06:27 <@Nexxy> except for the whining part
06:28 < _d4rklit3> ljharb, what if i wanted to make a prototype that i want to instance mulitple times?
06:28  * whiskers75 is mildly confused
06:29 <@ljharb> _d4rklit3: then var Builder = require(/*path to builder*/; [new Builder(), new Builder(), etc]
06:29 < wltsmrz> Pretty sure this does the same thing _d4rklit3 http://pastie.org/pastes/4369809/text?key=eklz25vughzakdpuabclg
06:30 < _d4rklit3> aaaah
06:30 < _d4rklit3> ok
06:30 < wltsmrz> You'd require() this file and then instantiate a new Builder with 'var builder = new something.Builder()'
06:30 <@ljharb> altho you don't need to assign module.exports.Builder - you can simply assign module.exports = Builder
06:30 < wltsmrz> Well
06:30 < wltsmrz> If you want to export nothing else
06:31 <@Nexxy> which is what you should want
06:31 <@Nexxy> always
06:31 <@ljharb> export as close to one thing as possible :-)
06:31 < _d4rklit3> awesome
06:31 < wltsmrz> My correction was a 1:1 functional copy of his original, that was the point
06:31 < _d4rklit3> to the max
06:31 < _d4rklit3> thanks
06:31 < wltsmrz> :thumbsup:
06:32 <@whiskers75> now why doesn't this work? https://gist.github.com/3209159
06:32 < Cat4D> more importantly, i need a visual schema/rdf structure creator with sufficient capacity to build from primitives up to full system with simulator/logic
06:32 <@Nexxy> speak of the devil
06:32 <@whiskers75> The console.log outputs "login"
06:32 <@ljharb> Cat4D: wtf? wheres that from
06:32 <@Nexxy> hi chjj 
06:32 <@whiskers75> ljharb: why isnt this working? https://gist.github.com/3209159
06:33 < _d4rklit3> has anyone used browserify?
06:33 <@whiskers75> console.log outputs "login"
06:33 <@ljharb> whiskers75: isn't that what you want?
06:33 <@whiskers75> yes - it's not matching
06:33 <@ljharb> whiskers75: you shouldn't need the json.stringify there tho. i was just saying to do that in the console.log, not to cmd itself
06:34 <@whiskers75> ok, butt 
06:34 <@whiskers75> but*
06:34 <@whiskers75> ill still keep it
06:34 <@whiskers75> i like it there :)
06:34 <@ljharb> … why? it's unnecessary
06:34 <@whiskers75> ok fine...
06:36 <@whiskers75> it doesn't seem to be writing anything back to the user
06:37 <@prettyrobots> Programming is hard
06:37 <@prettyrobots> .
06:39 < _d4rklit3> i dont htink i even understand wtf browserify does
06:39 <@whiskers75> prettyrobots: i agree
06:39 <@prettyrobots> _d4rklit3: It resolves module dependencies, creates a file that you can send to the browser that has all your stuff in it.
06:40 <@prettyrobots> It does what AMD does, but sync with a pre-compiler.
06:40 < _d4rklit3> lol am i crazy, because the docs are full of crazy
06:40 < _d4rklit3> can i use it to render client side code?
06:40 <@prettyrobots> SubStack docs are kooky, but that makes programming fun.
06:40 < _d4rklit3> or compile*
06:41 <@prettyrobots> Compile? That sounds like CoffeeScript talk.
06:41 < _d4rklit3> minify, uglify
06:41 < _d4rklit3> etc
06:41 <@prettyrobots> Maybe. Or you can do that as a second step.
06:42 < _d4rklit3> oo wait
06:42 <@prettyrobots> Not sure. I wouldn't be surprised if browserfy had a minifier option, but I wouldn't fault it if it didn't.
06:42 < _d4rklit3> does browserify let you request certain js files on the client
06:42 <@prettyrobots> I'd put that in my Makefile.
06:42 <@prettyrobots> Yes.
06:42 < _d4rklit3> aah ok
06:42 <@prettyrobots> Well, kind of. Unlike AMD, it is not dynamic.
06:43  * prettyrobots Is almost certainly wrong about everything he says.
06:43 < _d4rklit3> i dont need that then. because im building a single page canvas app, i just want it on a node server for connections
06:43 < zak_> prettyrobots: thats why i say nothing at all
06:43 <@prettyrobots> zak_: That's taking the easy way out.
06:43 <@whiskers75> Thanks for all the help, I finally fixed my program!
06:43 <@SubStack> _d4rklit3: if you're building a single page app browserify is better for those
06:43 <@prettyrobots> zak_: Whereas I comple my JavaScript to C++ so it will be web scale.
06:44 <@SubStack> since you just create a bundle and then everything is in there
06:44 <@SubStack> and you just generate a new bundle when you have new code
06:44 < _d4rklit3> so i would use Cake on the coffe then tell browserify to compress all the js files cake creates and serve them up to the browser
06:44 < zak_> prettyrobots: what are you using to do that?!
06:45 < zak_> somebody linked me to one a long time ago
06:45 <@prettyrobots> zak_: I was making a joke of saying something rediculously wrong.
06:45 < zak_> my bad
06:45 <@prettyrobots> zak_: WebScale™ is the top off.
06:45 < zak_> I think somebody wrote something that analyzes Javascript and makes it run faster
06:45 <@prettyrobots> Erm, tip off.
06:47 <@deoxxa> zak_: emscripten
06:47 <@deoxxa> oh sorry, wrong direction
06:48 <@deoxxa> lel
06:48 <@deoxxa> that's c++ -> js
06:48 < zak_> yeah, but thanks for sharing that. Neat
06:48 < zak_> Javascript is getting faster and faster
06:48 < zak_> they wrote some video codec thingo using JS right?
06:48 < zak_> and it was getting 30 fps
06:49 <@deoxxa> crazy
06:49 < zak_> yeah, H 264 decoder
06:49 <@deoxxa> typed arrays are the shit for high performance js
06:49 < zak_> actually, it turns out that the guy who did that used emscripten
06:49 < zak_> but he also optimized it further
06:49 <@deoxxa> ha
06:49 < zak_> http://badassjs.com/post/12035631618/broadway-an-h-264-decoder-in-javascript-running-at
06:50 < zak_> I wonder if Google's "Dart" language is dead yet
06:50 <@Nexxy> let's not be that way
06:50 <@ljharb> on it's way i hope.
06:50 <@Nexxy> ._.
06:51 < zak_> I'm not sure how I feel about it
06:51 <@ljharb> theres one part about the concept - making a new language that compiles to faster JS (which i dislike)
06:51 < zak_> Javascript has some terrible fundamental inconsistencies, but people have managed to work around them
06:51 <@ljharb> but the other part is dart's own syntax, which is just awful. if i wanted to write java, i'd write java.
06:51 <@prettyrobots> broadway.js is stunning.
06:52 <@prettyrobots> Wow.
06:52 <@Nexxy> ljharb, but dart has its own vm
06:52 <@ljharb> everything JS that google produces feels like java programmers trying desperately to write JS with eclipse in a java style
06:52 <@Nexxy> the whole JS thing seemed like a transitional phase?
06:52 <@ljharb> yes, thats probably true
06:52 <@ljharb> i think they should have skipped that phase and just shipped native dart support in chrome.
06:53 <@Nexxy> it was my understanding that they were trying to gain wider adoption than just chrome
06:53 <@ljharb> not that i think the language is any good, at ALL, but at least that would have avoided the JS compiling monstrosity of it.
06:53 <@prettyrobots> ljharb: Google is a big Java shop.
06:53 <@ljharb> prettyrobots: i know. that's not a compliment.
06:53 < zak_> fat chance of M$ putting Dart in IE. Same can be said for Apple with Safari
06:53 <@prettyrobots> ljharb: They took over the direction of Java even before Sun set.
06:54 <@ljharb> prettyrobots: java sucks. they can keep their ownership of it.
06:54 <@prettyrobots> Dart will never go anywhere.
06:54 <@prettyrobots> For the reasons zak_ said.
06:54 <@prettyrobots> Neither Apple nor Microsoft will ever support it.
06:54 <@ljharb> if someone made ActionScript.js, the response would be the same. desperate flash programmers trying to survive in a world in which they are increasingly irrelevant.
06:55 <@prettyrobots> ljharb: Ouch. You're mean.
06:55 <@Nexxy> hey
06:55 <@Nexxy> prettyrobots, this is what I'm sayin
06:55 <@prettyrobots> Hey, why isn't _zak an operator.
06:55 < zak_> we're all going to be shortly replaced by robots anyway. Get on the flash hating bandwagon guys
06:55 <@prettyrobots> ?
06:55 < Shanecowherd> I have a quick question, I'm using jsdom, is there a way to get the outerHtml of an element?
06:55 <@Nexxy> cuz he hasn't said 'ops plz' ?
06:56 < zak_> prettyrobots: because i'm the black sheep in ryan's social experiment
06:56 <@prettyrobots> Nexxy: I know, right?
06:56 <@prettyrobots> zak_: Hah.
06:56 <@Nexxy> lol
06:56 <@prettyrobots> ljharb: I didn't mean for you to stop.
06:56 -!- mode/#node.js [+o zak_] by IRCbot_Master

06:56 <@whiskers75> it does not work - oh
06:56 <@Nexxy> you already had ops
06:56 <@Nexxy> lol
06:57 < skeptic> I loath flash, but it's here for a long, long time to come.  I'm glad adobe is botching (means for a faster death) the whole thing, but i think as a company it's stupid of them
06:57 <@whiskers75> i know - i was testing ops plz
06:57 <@ljharb> i interview tons of java devs. most of them can't program their way out of a box without eclipse and classical inheritance.
06:57 <@prettyrobots> How do you get a Java dev to miss deadline?
06:57 <@ljharb> and theyre all desperately trying to get a JS job.
06:57 <@zak_> i use java too, but i actually hate Eclipse
06:57 <@Lorentz> netbeans is nicer imo
06:57 <@prettyrobots> Just say three simple words: Law of Demeter.
06:58 <@zak_> any IDE that decides it wants to do something on my behalf that takes more than 5 seconds basically gets a thumbs down from me
06:58 <@zak_> and I shouldn't have to go through several preference pages to turn that default behaviour off
06:58 <@deoxxa> ComponentFactoryFactoryRegistryInterface ComponentFactoryRegistryFactoryImplementation::instance() {}
06:58 <@prettyrobots> Anytime you say Law of Demeter a Java dev *must* refactor or else the ghost of Gostling will throw an unchecked exception at them.
06:58 <@zak_> haha

07:01 <@prettyrobots> SubStack: When GitHub.
07:01 <@deoxxa> SubStack: about 20 minutes ago
07:01 <@SubStack> oh right I see it now
07:01 <@SubStack> had to refresh twitter
07:02 <@prettyrobots> Twitter?
07:03 <@SomeoneWeird> grr, anyone good with socketio?
07:03 <@SomeoneWeird> can't get my pages to load the client
07:03 < dgx> Hey all. Just installed npm@windows and used npm install less. where are the files downloaded by default and can i change the dir ?
07:09 < wltsmrz> SomeoneWeird, https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/wiki/How-do-I-serve-the-client ?
07:10 <@SomeoneWeird> tried that, even had a mate look at the code
07:10 <@SomeoneWeird> everything looks like it should work
07:10 < wltsmrz> Must have a conflicting route
07:11 < wltsmrz> Out of curiosity which version of Express are you using?
07:11 < wltsmrz> Oh I just assumed you were using Express.
07:11 < wltsmrz> Maybe you aren't.
07:11 <@SomeoneWeird> i aam
07:11 < wltsmrz> Version? npm ls
07:11 <@SomeoneWeird> and hmm maybe the routes are breaking it
07:11 <@SomeoneWeird> 3 beta
07:11 <@SomeoneWeird> 3 beta7
07:12 < wltsmrz> Is all I can think of. Would you try npm install express@2.5.11 first?
07:12 < wltsmrz> I've heard rumblings about incompatibility and I've been griefed as well by beta Express.
07:12 < wltsmrz> Just a suggestion.
07:12 <@SomeoneWeird> x.X registry is down
07:13 <@SomeoneWeird> lol did the express website just change
07:13 <@SomeoneWeird> in like last 5 minutes
07:13 < wltsmrz> Different from when I last saw it anyway :O
07:24 <@SomeoneWeird> holy crap that worked wltsmrz 
07:24 <@SomeoneWeird> thanks
07:25 < wltsmrz> :thumbsup:
07:27 <@SomeoneWeird> is there a way to listen on all socketio channels?
07:27 <@SomeoneWeird> actually nevermind
07:35 < TonkaTruck> SomeoneWeird: socket.io is a node gateway drug.

07:54 < jetienne> hi
08:14 < _Tristan> If I use socket.io to send lots of things quickly, will they arrive in the correct order?
08:15 < jetienne> _Tristan: yes
08:15 < _Tristan> yey
08:15 < jetienne> order is preserved
08:15 < `3rdEden> jetienne _Tristan maaaaybe
08:15 < jetienne> come on ?
08:15 < `3rdEden> Socket.io doesn't provide any guarantees
08:15 < jetienne> `3rdEden: ???
08:15 < `3rdEden> jetienne the messages arent numbered ;)
08:16 < _Tristan> I don't wanna number my messages
08:16 < jetienne> `3rdEden: socket.io may change the order of the message ?
08:16 < _Tristan> op plz
08:16 -!- mode/#node.js [+o _Tristan] by ryan_opper
08:16 < `3rdEden> jetienne it's up to the transports to deliver the messages, which is order most of the time
08:16 < jetienne> `3rdEden: oh ok, i think i understand
08:17 -!- _Tristan changed the topic of #Node.js to: The Official Node Javascript Support IRC Channel - http://nodejs.org/#haberdashery
08:17 < jetienne> `3rdEden: the software socket.io (not the underlying network) do not reorder messages <- this is correct ?
08:17 < `3rdEden> so we send it in order over HTTP/Websockets, but we do not confirm that they have actually arrived in order in the client side
08:17 < jetienne> `3rdEden: websocket messages arent reordered (as specified by the spec) <- this is correct ?
08:17 < `3rdEden> we simply assume that it's received in order
08:18 < jetienne> websocket garantee order
08:18 < jetienne> message are received in the order they got sent
08:18 < `3rdEden> jetienne they are just pushed to the transport in the order that you send the messages
08:18 < jetienne> ah :)
08:19 < jetienne> `3rdEden: any transport which may reorder the message ?
08:19 <@_Tristan> ..sooo
08:19 < jetienne> stuff using a request per message can reorder for sure
08:19 <@_Tristan> I guess I'll just number my messages then?
08:20 < jetienne> _Tristan: good point. i never realise that messaage may be reorderer in some case
08:21 < `3rdEden> jetienne _Tristan i'm just saying that it might be possible that for some odd reason your messages are not received in the same order as we do not do any checking for message orders on the client & server side
08:22 < jetienne> `3rdEden: for many usages, reordering messages is a problem
08:23 < `3rdEden> So if you need to be 1000% sure that your messages are received in order, i would number them. But most of them you can just expect that they arrive in order
08:23 < jetienne> true that with all the transports... socket.io is fluctuating. i will reduce the transports options
08:23 < jetienne> `3rdEden: maybe you could look at the transports and see about reordering and lost message
08:23 <@_Tristan> my purpose is to read a log file on the server and stream it to the client
08:24 < jetienne> `3rdEden: put that in a little table. thus people would know :) just suggesting :)
08:24 < TonkaTruck> lawl...websockets in order http://badankles.com/?p=209
08:24 <@_Tristan> every time it gets a chunk from fs.readFile it sends it to the client
08:24 <@_Tristan> so I'll know soon whether or not these messages will get reordered in the process
08:25 < TonkaTruck> There must be a node implementation of his java.
08:26 < `3rdEden> _Tristan just assume that they are send in order
08:26 < `3rdEden> it's not like your whole wold will explode if it doesn't
08:27 < `3rdEden> because you are working with an async system here

08:43 <@prettyrobots> tblobaum_: TIL!
08:44 <@SubStack> _d4rklit3: --exports=require
08:44 < _d4rklit3> tryin to do it middleware
08:45 <@SubStack> { exports : [ 'require' ] } in the opts
08:45 < _d4rklit3> im reading that in your methods markdown
08:45 < _d4rklit3> this is all very new to me
08:46 <@SubStack> by default require() only works inside of the bundle unless you don't have any entry files
08:46 < sha0coder> hi noder
08:46 <@SubStack> in which case the bundle would be completely inert so it exports the require function
08:46 < sha0coder> s
08:46 <@SubStack> to the containing scope
08:46 <@SubStack> this preserves the usage of browserify -r lib1 -r lib2 and makes it so that require() doesn't bleed out when people use entry files
08:47 < strk> what's the policy for v8 uprades in node version ? Will we have v8 3.12 into node 0.8 branch ?
08:47 < _d4rklit3> ok cool
08:48 < _d4rklit3> that seemed to have work
08:48 < _d4rklit3> nice that the author is in this chan :P
08:48 < _d4rklit3> irc ftw
08:48 < be5invis> any here knows jscex?
08:51 < _d4rklit3> hrmm
08:51 < _d4rklit3> require('coffee-script')
08:51 < _d4rklit3> that should work no?
08:51 < _d4rklit3> hah yeah it should if coffee is installed
08:55 < _d4rklit3> anyone ever see "reserved word "function" on line1"  error from require('coffee-script')
08:57 < hans> I'm installing node on centos, and stucked on ./configure with invalid syntax error at line 273.
08:57 < hans> how can I solve it?
09:00 < _d4rklit3> do i need to write my node app in coffee in order to use coffee?
09:01 <@SubStack> _d4rklit3: nope, you can mix and match
09:01 < _d4rklit3> im getting errors with coffee = require('coffee-script');
09:01 < _d4rklit3> not sure how to get it in there
09:01 < _d4rklit3> do i need to use a Cake task to compile the coffee before running the server?
09:02 <@mscdex> hans: what node version and what centos version?
09:02 <@SubStack> when you require('coffee-script') it registers a custom handler such that you can require('./foo.coffee')
09:03 <@SubStack> oh wait that might have changed
09:03 < _d4rklit3> i have to register .coffee
09:03 < _d4rklit3> it seems
09:03 <@SubStack> right, that
09:03 < _d4rklit3> when i try do this, i get an error
09:03 < _d4rklit3> "reserved word "function" on line1"  
09:03 <@SubStack> require.registerExtension
09:04 < _d4rklit3> where does that go?
09:04 <@SubStack> oh wait, says to use require.extensions instead
09:04 < _d4rklit3> where do i read this?
09:08 < _d4rklit3> where does this require.extensions get set?
09:11 < _d4rklit3> everythign i read about coffee in node is in coffee :(
09:14 < sabermonk> hi, i am trying ti use util.inherits(A,B) , but i am getting : Object prototype may only be an Object or null  what am i doing wrong?
09:15 <@SubStack> _d4rklit3: the latest coffee-script seems a bit broken :/
09:15 < _d4rklit3> o yay
09:15 < _d4rklit3> lol
09:15 <@SubStack> maybe somebody is maintaining a version that sets require.extensions correctly
09:15 < _d4rklit3> 1.3.3
09:17 < _d4rklit3> do you happen to remember what version worked?
09:19 <@SubStack> oh wait!
09:19 <@SubStack> it actually should work just fine after you require('coffee-script')
09:19 < _d4rklit3> thats hat i did
09:19 <@SubStack> require('coffee-script'); require('./foo')
09:19 <@SubStack> should work
09:19 < _d4rklit3> what is foo?
09:19 <@SubStack> ./foo.coffee I meant
09:19 < _d4rklit3> i require http://pastie.org/4370367
09:20 < _d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/4370367
09:20 < _d4rklit3> well
09:20 < _d4rklit3> ideally i would like to give browserify a folder full of coffee files
09:20 < _d4rklit3> or a tree
09:20 < _d4rklit3> and let it do its thing into one .js file
09:21 <@SubStack> _d4rklit3: just do browserify dir/*.coffee -o bundle.js
09:21 < _d4rklit3> is there a middleware way to do this?
09:21 < _d4rklit3> so my server does it on request
09:21 <@AAA_awright> Where does visionmedia hang out
09:22 <@SubStack> _d4rklit3: could use fs.readdir
09:22 <@SubStack> I would just use the command though

09:28 < mmalecki> AAA_awright: ^ there you go
09:29 <@AAA_awright> I just asked NickServ, 3 hours ago it looks like
09:30 <@AAA_awright> Well while I'm here: Guys, please, if you're developing modules, tell me where I can download the dependencies
09:31 < mmalecki> AAA_awright: from npm?
09:31 <@AAA_awright> As in, Git
09:31 <@AAA_awright> Some of us don't use npm >:(
09:32 <@mscdex> why?
09:32 <@AAA_awright> I'm actually writing up an article explaining all the semantics of Node.js, including proper usage of package managers
09:33 <@AAA_awright> The nutshell version is npm doesn't carry meaningful metadata for good development
09:34 <@AAA_awright> git submodules are the right way to go
09:34 <@SubStack> o_O
09:34 <@SubStack> everytime I've interacted with git submodules I have not had a worthwhile experience
09:35 <@mscdex> ^
09:35 <@rvagg> ditto
09:37 <@AAA_awright> SubStack: While submodules are the only way so far I've seen that properly handle revisioning information, yeah, the UI is in fact slightly harder to use.
09:37 <@AAA_awright> Luckily it's only slightly harder
09:37 <@AAA_awright> I've got a few scripts to help me out with npm<->submodules, I still have to polish those up and publish them
09:38 <@SubStack> what is inadequate about version numbers for your purposes?
09:40 <@AAA_awright> First of all it forces you to be tied to a central repository with no namespaces, where packages have been renamed at-will, etc. I don't like the idea of package managers in general. npm is no exception.
09:40 <@AAA_awright> But probably more importantly, they don't carry development histories. Checking in entire dependnecies to your project, as Node.js does for V8, npm (!), and other things is even worse.
09:41 <@AAA_awright> If you're simply cloning, submodules are a snap: git clone xyz; cd xyz; git submodule init
09:41 < `3rdEden> op plz
09:41 -!- mode/#node.js [+o `3rdEden] by ryan_opper
09:42 <@AAA_awright> No mucking around with package managers or version numbers that are supposed to be semantic but more often than not aren;t
09:42 <@AAA_awright> semver essentially says 0.* has no semantics whatsoever
09:42 <@AAA_awright> How many people are publishing packages with a 0 major revision number?
09:42 <@AAA_awright> Node.js hasn't picked up a major revision number yet!
09:43 <@`3rdEden> git submodules? FUUUU that whole concept should have been banned from git
09:43 <@AAA_awright> Why?
09:43 <@AAA_awright> It's perfectly logical and very meaningful
09:43 <@`3rdEden> Sure, but pretty badly implemented
09:43 <@AAA_awright> Git itself wasn't the easiest to use in the beginning either :p
09:43 < jetienne> yeah super confusing
09:44 <@AAA_awright> Now I'm saying everyone seems to have a problem with it, I don't. You just have to read the manual... git submodule add <whatever>, git submodule update, etc
09:44 <@AAA_awright> Most of it seems self-explanatory
09:44 < jetienne> AAA_awright: even you, you did a mistake in your example :)
09:45 < jetienne> submodules are a snap: git clone xyz; cd xyz; git submodule init <- you need reccursive here
09:45 < strk> can anyone explain me the meaning of this line ?
09:45 < strk>   111183 ms: Mark-sweep 11.2 (48.0) -> 11.2 (48.0) MB, 1153 / 1166 ms [external memory allocation limit reached] [GC in old space requested].
09:46 < strk> is first column the time of the event ? (at millisecond 111183 since start of process) ?
09:46 <@AAA_awright> jetienne: Actually I don't, there's a whole reason why that has do to with Node.js dependencies and the node_modules scanning
09:46 < mmalecki> strk: that's v8 doing garbage collection, I believe
09:46 < strk> yes, I know it is, just trying to understand the meaning of each column
09:46 < strk> in particular I don't understand the 1153 / 1166 part
09:46 < jetienne> AAA_awright: if you dont, and the submodules got submodules, the install fails
09:46 < strk> sounds like number of ms it took for that specific GC run
09:47 <@AAA_awright> I've got a few scripts that should make the use of `git submodule <command>` go away, so you get the benefits of submodules in your repository, without needing to maintain them by hand
09:47 < strk> but then I don't understand how it is possible for two subsequent lines to have the same value in the first column (can't run ~1 second of GC every sub-millisecond)
09:47 < strk> ie:
09:47 < strk>   111183 ms: Mark-sweep 11.2 (48.0) -> 11.2 (48.0) MB, 1336 / 1351 ms [external memory allocation limit reached] [GC in old space requested].
09:47 <@AAA_awright> jetienne: If my submodules have submodules, I explicitly *dont* want them to check anything out
09:47 < strk>   111183 ms: Mark-sweep 11.3 (48.0) -> 11.2 (48.0) MB, 1351 / 1364 ms [external memory allocation limit reached] [GC in old space requested].
09:48 < jetienne> AAA_awright: then the install fails
09:48 <@AAA_awright> I handle all their dependencies at the first level
09:48 <@`3rdEden> If you allready need scripts to work with submodules.... it has red flags all over it
09:48 <@AAA_awright> jetienne: Not for Node.js packages, at least the way I'm doing it

10:06 <@Bux> nodejitsu wont take it
10:06 <@Bux> it gives errors for some reason
10:06 < necolas> what's a simple solution to creating a zip file from an entire directory (and preserving structure)?
10:07 <@Bux> ok, I pushed it
10:07 <@whiskers75> ok, ill pull it
10:07 <@Nexxy> Bux, where is teh source?
10:07 <@Bux> how did you get in nodester
10:07 <@Bux> I thought it was coupon only..
10:07 <@Nexxy> you can just bug chris
10:08 < timoxley> necolas probably just shell out to a program like zip or tar…
10:08 <@whiskers75> Bux: I had an account there
10:08 <@whiskers75> Bux: no changes to me
10:08 <@Bux> oh cool
10:08 <@Bux> any way you can invite me?
10:08 <@whiskers75> From git://github.com/JeromSar/IRC-bot * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
10:08 <@whiskers75> Already up-to-date.
10:08 < necolas> timoxley: it needs to work on all platforms, so it would be nice if done in node :/
10:08 <@whiskers75> don't think so... ill see
10:09 < timoxley> necolas https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar
10:09 <@whiskers75> no, you need to request a coupon
10:09 <@whiskers75> So Bux: not getting anything from git, ill try again
10:09 <@Bux> hold on, forgot to auth _-_
10:10 <@Nexxy> Bux, are you on twitter?
10:10 <@Bux> ok done

10:14 < davv3> i have a gimpy nodejs irc-bot @ https://github.com/dawik/bottle-nodejs
10:14 < asadpakistani1> mscdex: exactly wht i seek...thanks
10:15 < davv3> though it hasnt been updated since i discovered bitbucket
10:15 < davv3> and also wrote a module for that :p
10:15  * mscdex shakes a fist at bitbucket
10:16 <@Nexxy> switchto #ohai
10:16 < davv3> bitbucket > github !
10:16 <@mscdex> condition not met!
10:17 <@Nexxy> Bux, https://github.com/JeromSar/IRC-bot/blob/master/.ssh/key
10:17 <@Nexxy> you might want to fix that
10:18 <@Bux> I know
10:18 <@Bux> but I dont use it :P
10:18 <@Bux> its a booby trap
10:18 < sha0coder> better bitbucket ;)
10:18 < mmalecki> Bux: why'd you even need it?
10:18 <@fly-> bitbucket <3
10:18 <@fly-> i only use bitbucket for private repos tho
10:19 <@Bux> for a remote node Host
10:19 < davv3> fly-: +1
10:19 <@Bux> to upload with SSH
10:19 <@Nexxy> for heroku
10:19 <@Bux> but it doesnt work
10:19 <@mscdex> github is where it's at yo
10:20 <@Nexxy> linode + gitolite IMHO
10:20 <@mscdex> no gitlab?
10:20 <@Nexxy> was not aware of this gitlab
10:21 <@Nexxy> > roR
10:21 <@Nexxy> nty
10:21 <@mscdex> go write one in node Nexxy!
10:21 <@mscdex> you can win the hearts and minds of developers!
10:22 <@Nexxy> oh man
10:22 <@Nexxy> I'm writing enough things right now
10:22 <@mscdex> :-D
10:22 <@Nexxy> things I actually need
10:22 <@fly-> gitlab is pretty sweet
10:22 <@fly-> unfortunately ruby
10:22 <@mscdex> fork gitlab and swap the backend with node
10:22 <@mscdex> ta-da
10:22 <@Nexxy> idek what gitlab does
10:23 <@mscdex> it's like a github-style clone
10:23 <@Nexxy> just project management stuff ?
10:23 <@Nexxy> oh
10:24 <@mscdex> it uses gitolite
10:24 <@Nexxy> I see that
10:24 <@Nexxy> all I'd really use is the diffs and maybe branch vis
10:26 < davv3> gitlab defo looks nice !
10:27 < davv3> second mscdex suggestion :)
10:28 <@Nexxy> but you can't even sign in with github
10:28 <@mscdex> huh?
10:28 < davv3> le fork and port

10:31 < Deputaats> Hi
10:31 < Deputaats> I'm using Node.js + MysQL
10:32 < davv3> json is a data-format... http://json.org
10:32 < davv3> jeez !
10:32 < davv3> Nexxy: lol!
10:33 < Deputaats> If I execute queery which takes ~18 seconds or more and Node.JS tries to query MysQL in the same time, seems taht connection breaks,. and w/o errors, seems like node.js is waiting forever for mysql to respond. 
10:33 < Deputaats> Have something like this happened to you ?
10:33 < Deputaats> Where to lok for answers..?
10:33 < jetienne> davv3: you have to realize that he went to the trouble to type this url :)
10:33 <@Nexxy> what?
10:37 <@SomeoneWeird> Deputaats, its supposed to, its async
10:38 < Deputaats> I need node.js to wait longer.. or mysql to respond eventually.
10:38 <@rvagg> Deputaats: which mysql connector lib are you using?
10:39 < Deputaats> mysql with generic-pool
10:39 < Deputaats> exactly this one: npm install mysql@2.0.0-alpha3
10:39 <@AAA_awright> Alright, getting started on my dissertation(-length report) on ECMAScript/Node.js semantics, heh. <http://magnode.org/nodejs-design-demantics>

10:45 <@AAA_awright> No no, thanks for the opinion :)
10:45 <@rvagg> oh man, perhaps you boys ought to take your bot play to a separate channel
10:46 <@AAA_awright> idk I sort of like the bot nonsense
10:46 <@AAA_awright> 250 operators, what other channel can claim that
10:46 <@whiskers75> They're Bux's and mine's IRC bots :)
10:46 <@Bux> :D
10:46 <@rvagg> it's kind of noisy
10:46 <@whiskers75> the bot?
10:46 <@Bux> its VERY quiet :)
10:47 <@Bux> only moves when you poke it :)
10:47 <@Nexxy> you can /ignore IRCbot_*!*@*
10:47 <@Nexxy> that helps a little ;\
10:47 <@whiskers75> Just don't ask to see the welcome function
10:47 <@Bux> haha yeah :P
10:47 <@SubStack> AAA_awright: an event emitter with only one type of event should probably just be a callback
10:47 <@rvagg> it's noisy with you guys playing around with them
10:47 <@SubStack> no need to do what you advocate with .on(fn)
10:47 <@rvagg> and me talking about it
10:47  * rvagg tunes out
10:47 <@Bux> whisk, msg @ c9.io
10:47 <@Nexxy> rvagg, I suggested a testing channel yesterday too, they didn't listen :P
10:48 <@AAA_awright> hmm
10:48 <@whiskers75> Bux: its not working
10:48 <@Bux> try now
10:48 <@whiskers75> Bux: reload
10:48 <@AAA_awright> SubStack: No, there is, if multiple people want to subscribe to events
10:48 <@AAA_awright> Or if you're emitting a non-singluar number of events
10:48 <@whiskers75> say something Bux
10:48 <@SubStack> ah that makes a little sense then
10:48 <@Bux> yeah?
10:49 <@SubStack> AAA_awright: non-singular? I don't get that use case
10:49 <@SubStack> just use a callback
10:49 <@SubStack> callbacks get called multiple times all the time
10:49 <@SubStack> like http.createServer
10:49 <@SubStack> or map/forEach/reduce/filter
10:50 <@Bux> whisk, Im chatting to you?
10:50 <@whiskers75> Bux: you need to reload
10:50 <@Bux> reload c9?
10:50 <@whiskers75> yeah - quit your browser
10:51 <@whiskers75> ill do the same
10:51 <@Bux> done
10:51 <@whiskers75> reloading...
10:51 <@whiskers75> done
10:52 <@AAA_awright> SubStack: Reload, I think I just took or edited that word out ("singular")
10:53 <@IRCbot_Master> Bux: disabling IRCbot...
10:53 <@AAA_awright> Also note that I'm editing this page with the software the website is advertising :)
10:54 <@AAA_awright> I should probably find a more specific name than simply callback, which is really just a function passed to a function-call
11:08 <@AAA_awright> SubStack: Also, map/forEach/reduce/filter is guarenteed to happen synchronously
11:08 <@AAA_awright> I should probably work that in, but that's not going to be one of the asynchronous patterns
11:41 < spionHL> installing stuff to ~/node_modules is a really shitty idea.
11:42 < CIA-93> node: Ben Noordhuis v0.8 * rcccce60 / tools/installer.js : installer: don't assume bash is installed - http://git.io/d5Y5sA
11:42 <@AAA_awright> spionHL: Heh yeah, just use the application ./node_modules instead?
11:42 < spionHL> well, for some reason the latest node, it installs "global" packages into ~/node_modules if -g is not used 
11:43 <@AAA_awright> node doesn't install packages >_>
11:43 < spionHL> node now contains npm
11:43 < spionHL> npm does install packages.
11:43 <@AAA_awright> Right
11:44 <@AAA_awright> (node shouldn't contain anything much less npm but that's besides the point)
11:44 < spionHL> npm installs things in ~/node_modules - this is so wrong.
11:44 < spionHL> broke my cross-platform ant build script immediately
11:44 <@xerox> it doesn't
11:44 <@AAA_awright> Don't you have to go -l for local?
11:44 <@AAA_awright> Or was some additional switch added
11:44 <@AAA_awright> hmm
11:45 <@mscdex> "global" packages?
11:46 < spionHL> some packages, e.g. express need to be installed globally to work normally
11:46 < jetienne> spionHL: express works if installed locally
11:46 <@mscdex> they don't _need_ to be installed glboally
11:46 <@mscdex> especially express
11:47 < spionHL> you either install it globally or you don't get to call express from the command line.
11:47 <@xerox> https://npmjs.org/doc/install.html
11:47 <@mscdex> fwiw i never use express from the command line
11:47 < jetienne> spionHL: or you config your shell :)
11:47 <@mscdex> i don't think i've ever used any command line stuff from a package
11:49 < spionHL> mscdex, irrelevant
11:49 <@mscdex> not for me :-D
11:49 <@xerox> better https://npmjs.org/doc/folders.html
11:50 <@xerox> :)
11:50 < stoke> mscdex: command line packages are quite handy, just saying
11:50 <@mscdex> maybe
11:50 < spionHL> so uhh
11:50 < spionHL> why does npm install some packages in ~/node_modules
11:50 < spionHL> and some in ./node_modules ?
11:50 <@xerox> it doesn't
11:50 <@xerox> read that thing I linked
11:50 < bnoordhuis> spionHL: install vs install -g
11:51 < bnoordhuis> i.e. local vs global install
11:51 <@xerox> but global does not install in ~/node_modules at all
11:51 < spionHL> non-global just installed in ~
11:51 < bnoordhuis> no, in ~/.npm
11:51 <@xerox> …and local does not either
11:51 < bnoordhuis> some old modules install in ~/node_modules
11:52 < spionHL> requirejs is not old, and in 0.8.0 it did not install in ~
11:52 < stoke> https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/install.js :/
11:52 < jetienne> npm install blabla <- this install where ? in local dir ? 
11:52 < bnoordhuis> e.g. if you install node-iconv with the makefile, it'll install to ~/node_modules
11:52 <@xerox> jetienne: https://npmjs.org/doc/folders.html
11:52 < jetienne> xerox: super
11:52 < jetienne> xerox: the question is still holding
11:52 <@Nexxy> spionHL, are you sure you didn't run the command in ~ ?
11:52 <@xerox> : (
11:52 < spionHL> Nexxy, yup
11:52 < spionHL> Perhaps its because the folder contains ( )
11:52 < spionHL> I sure hope not.
11:52 < spionHL> I'll do more tests.
11:52 < jetienne> xerox: if you know the answer, please share
11:53 <@xerox> it's in the first paragraph
11:53 < jetienne> xerox: sure

12:07 <@whiskers75> what?

12:07 <@whiskers75> oh ryan?
12:07 <@SomeoneWeird> why would that be?

12:07 <@whiskers75> check this out
12:07 <@IRCbot_Master> undefined1 2 3 4 5 
12:07 <@SomeoneWeird> spionHL, npm looks up level till ~, if it finds a folder called 'node_modules' it will install the modules in there, else it will create a folder in the current dir and install there
12:08 <@Bux> haha :P
12:08 <@whiskers75> Bux: oops
12:08 <@Bux> hehe
12:08 <@whiskers75> Bux: lets fix that
12:08 <@Bux> we better fix that
12:08 <@whiskers75> to c9 we go!
12:08 < spionHL> SomeoneWeird, so the existance of ~/node_modules causes this.
12:08 <@SomeoneWeird> yes
12:08 <@SomeoneWeird> whiskers75, Bux test and stuff in a different channel, and when it works bring it in here
12:08 < spionHL> ... so why exactly does it "look up level" ?
12:09 <@SomeoneWeird> dont ask  me
12:09 <@whiskers75> SomeoneWeird: no we do not
12:10 <@SomeoneWeird> ?
12:10 <@whiskers75> SomeoneWeird: we use Cloud9 IDE (c9)
12:10 <@SomeoneWeird> .......?
12:10 <@whiskers75> http://c9.io/
12:10 <@SomeoneWeird> i know what it is
12:11 <@SomeoneWeird> wtf does that have todo with what I was saying?
12:11 <@SomeoneWeird> spionHL, http://pastie.org/4371084
12:11 <@whiskers75> we do not test stuff in a diff channel
12:12 <@SomeoneWeird> well, i'm telling you to
12:12 <@rvagg> you're not the first one SomeoneWeird, or the second
12:14 < spionHL> SomeoneWeird, thanks a bunch :)
12:14 <@SomeoneWeird> allgood :)
12:15 < spionHL> I had absolutely no idea that there was a ~/node_modules dir though. Someone typed a npm install command on the server without looking at pwd I guess
12:15 < spionHL> gah
12:16 <@xerox> there isn't :P
12:16 < spionHL> There is. If you npm install while in ~
12:16 < anu_free> hello, i am new to socket.io when i try to call socket.io.js in jade file it is giving 404 error. I m using express and jade.please let me know how to serve socket.io.js on jade file.	
12:16 <@Nexxy> spionHL, what's that? 
12:16 < spionHL> so basically, the documentation is incomplete.
12:16 < spionHL> npm install does not install in ./
12:16 <@Nexxy> yes it does
12:17 <@Nexxy> lol
12:17 <@xerox> haha
12:17 <@Nexxy> what are you on?
12:17 < hillerstorm> :)
12:17 < spionHL> it installs in ../node_modules if it already exists
12:17 < spionHL> or in ../../node_modules if it already exists
12:17 < spionHL> all the way up to ~/node_modules
12:18 < spionHL> good to know.
12:18 < hillerstorm> but by default it's ./
12:18 <@SomeoneWeird> Nexxy, http://pastie.org/4371084
12:18 <@SomeoneWeird> no hillerstorm 
12:19 < spionHL> thats incorrect. "default" means if you don't specify anything special.
12:19 <@SomeoneWeird> it defaults to the first node_modules folder it finds
12:19 <@SomeoneWeird> else it creates one
12:20 <@Nexxy> spionHL, https://npmjs.org/doc/folders.html
12:20 < hillerstorm> ah yea
12:20 < hillerstorm> but it never just installs it to ~/node_modules :)
12:21 <@Nexxy> spionHL, it serves a very useful purpose
12:21 < hillerstorm> unless that folder existed
12:21 <@SomeoneWeird> yah
12:21 < spionHL> Yes, its in "More information"
12:21 <@whiskers75> it is possible to switch the bot's channel :)
12:22 <@SomeoneWeird> do it, just while your coding it
12:22 <@whiskers75> no, now
12:22 <@whiskers75> its already coded
12:23 < spionHL> interesting though. putting node_modules in ~ will cause "fresh" npm install calls to stop working
12:23 < spionHL> :D
12:23 <@whiskers75> what channel should I switch to?
12:25 < bharath> may I know , how can I retrieve the GET and POST parameters using nodejs?
12:25 < IRCbot_Master> whiskers75: Enabling IRCbot...
12:26 < spionHL> I think its a bad design decision. It doesn't add much convenience (Just go to the bloody package root before installing, mate) and it adds a surprising behavior driven by non-local state.
12:27 < Nuck> spionHL: It's just emulating the behavior that Node.js itself makes in resolving require() statements, so I think it's a fine decision
12:27 < spionHL> fortunately easily fixed in build scripts by adding a mkdir command for node_modules
12:29 < spionHL> (err actually deployment scripts)
12:30 < spionHL> Nuck, in this case i still think its a bad idea. Its not "like" nodejs at all, as in node you require a specific script. npm only requires a node_modules dir (with possibly totally unrelated modules) to exist to behave this way.
12:31 < spionHL> wonder if it also breaks packages.json based npm install
12:35 <@mscdex> bharath: for POST data, you have to listen on the request's 'data' event and keep concatenating the incoming data until 'end' is emitted
12:35 <@mscdex> bharath: then you can use the built-in querystring module to parse it
12:35 <@mscdex> bharath: for GET parameters, look in req.url

13:31 <@Nexxy> aaaanyway.
13:31 <@SomeoneWeird> inflammation
13:31 <@Owner> Nexxy~# no
13:31 <@Nexxy> pretty sure STDs are beyond the scope of #node.js 
13:31 <@Nuck> Can we get off the topic of herpes?
13:32 <@Owner> no
13:32 <@hillerstorm> Nexxy: afaik js and scopes are a thing of their own
13:32 <@Nexxy> har har
13:32 <@Owner> hitlerstorm: i agree
13:32 <@Nuck> Can we just let this scope be garbage-collected?
13:33 <@Nuck> So let's just remove all references to the scope containing herpes, k?
13:33 <@Nuck> k.
13:33 <@hillerstorm> Owner: i see what you did there!
13:33 < bakadesu> but what about the Node Herpes module?  http://goo.gl/0Grsy
13:34 <@Nuck> bakadesu: If you're gonna use a pastebin, at LEAST use gist
13:34 <@Nuck> Seriously, have some standards, man
13:34 <@SomeoneWeird> <hillerstorm> Nexxy: afaik js and scopes are a thing of their own < lmao
13:34 < bakadesu> that paste isn't worthy of gist
13:35  * spion_ awaits let patiently.
13:42 < aus3ys> Anyone else experience errors on npm website, like: There was a problem! The server said: Failed creating account. CouchDB said: not_found ?
13:47 < cainus> hey all... anyone know how to test whether I'm on a 64 or 32-bit version of node?
13:49 <@SomeoneWeird> did you build it?
13:49 < cainus> yeah
13:49 <@SomeoneWeird> then it'll build for your OS arch
13:49 < cainus> ahh hmmm
13:50 <@SomeoneWeird> uname -r | grep amd64
13:50 < cainus> seems like a 32 bit version because every crc32 function I come across spits out the wrong values
13:50 <@SomeoneWeird> 0.o
13:50 <@SomeoneWeird> crc32 isnt cross arch?
13:51 < cainus> yeah amd64
13:51 <@SomeoneWeird> not sure
13:51 < cainus> well I've seen bugs in various languages for crc32 on 32-bit architecture
13:52 < timoxley> cainus require('os').arch() ?
13:52 < cainus> I'll try some other languages and see if they get the right answers
13:52 <@SomeoneWeird> timoxley, that'll get the system arch more than likely
13:52 < cainus> timoxley: x64
13:53 < timoxley> oh
13:53 < timoxley> youre right
13:53 < cainus> I compiled with 'n' so I wonder if that did something funky
13:53 < timoxley> cainus process.arch?
13:53 < cainus> timeoxley: same
13:54 < timoxley> gah they probably are the same function.
13:54 <@SomeoneWeird> n?
13:54 < wink_> cainus: are you on linux?  use file /path/to/node
13:54  * timoxley chimes out
13:54 < wink_> it'll tell you the arch of the binary
13:54 <@SomeoneWeird> heh, didnt think of that wingy 
13:54 <@SomeoneWeird> wink_, *
13:54 < cainus> /usr/local/bin/node: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x86f7357b637b5a0142d1572a938dbbbeb8ed6d51, not stripped
13:55 < wink_> there you have it, 64 bit node :p
13:55 < cainus> yep.
13:55 < cainus> damn.
13:55 < cainus> alright thanks guys
13:55 <@SomeoneWeird> :)
13:55 < wink_> what crc implementation are you using?
13:55 < cainus> tried both "crc" and "mhash"
13:56 < cainus> mhash has crc32 and crc32b also  (not sure the difference tbh)
13:56 < cainus> none of them give the right answers
13:56 < wink_> i think you're likely to find the error is somewhere in your test harness
13:56 <@SomeoneWeird> https://gist.github.com/749655
13:57 < wink_> can you gist it?
13:57 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
13:57 < cainus> it's a one liner:  console.log(hash("crc32", "alejandro"));  // should be AAC5A14F 
13:58 < cainus> i've checked against sites like http://crc32-checksum.waraxe.us/  ...  I'm porting the test from an rspec test that agrees with the online values
13:59 < wink_> cainus: what is this hash() function?
13:59 < wink_> its definitely not part of the node-crc lib?
13:59 < cainus> sorry... var hash = require("mhash").hash;
14:00 < cainus> crc.crc32("alejandro");  // yields -1429888689 ... which is not the decimal version of AAC5A14F
14:01 < cainus> decimal should be 2865078607
14:01 < wink_> sec
14:01 < cainus> thanks
14:01 < wink_> installing mhash
14:02 < cainus> seems crc and mhash libs disagree even
14:04 < ragnar_> in express.js, why does res.redirect('/smth') redirect to http://localhost/smth? Running on a cloud server behind apache proxy. 
14:04 < cainus> ragnar_: the server behind the proxy probably isn't getting its host header
14:06 < ragnar_> cainus: how can I see the http headers on requests between apache and node?
14:06 < cainus> ragnar_: you can check the host header in express with :   req.headers.host   ... that's probably localhost
14:07 <@SomeoneWeird> console.log(req.headers)
14:07 < cainus> or non existent actually
14:08 < cainus> express might be cool and look for x-forwarded-host from a proxy... I don't know
14:08 < wink_> cainus: yeah something is definitely off there, i just used php's crc32 algo and it worked a-ok
14:08 < ragnar_> It seems to be localhost:8000
14:08 < cainus> yeah something's off when php gets it right :)
14:08 < cainus> ruby gets it right too
14:08 < ragnar_> And I also get the 'x-forwarded for' headers
14:08 < cainus> ragnar_: do any have the host you want?
14:08 < wink_> looking at mhash, its bug is deep down, there is a test harness buried in the build directories and it fails as well
14:09 < wink_> so it's deeper than the node binding
14:09 < cainus> wink_: did you try crc?
14:09 < cainus> https://new.npmjs.org/package/crc
14:09 < ragnar_> My temporary fix is to res.redirect('http://example.com/smth'). Is there a way to set base url in express.js? 
14:10 < wink_> cainus: i didnt, but i've got less faith in that one as its a pure js implementation :p
14:10 < cainus> yeah...so weird
14:10 < cainus> alright thanks man... I just wanted to know I wasn't crazy
14:10 <@mscdex> cainus: the crc32 npm module works fine
14:11 < cainus> mscdex: crc32 is the name?
14:11 < wink_> seems to be
14:12 <@mscdex> yep
14:12 <@mscdex> works with buffers and strings
14:12 < cainus> mscdex: yep it does
14:12 < cainus> fantastic... thanks
14:13 < wink_> cainus: does work
14:13 < wink_> ++
14:13 < cainus> yeah I'm surprised at the other two libs... maybe I should log some bugs
14:13 < wink_> please :p
14:14 <@mscdex> crc32 isn't that good though
14:14 < cainus> it's just for message verification... not for passwords
14:14 < cainus> meant for speed
14:14 <@mscdex> xxhash is faster :-D
14:15 < cainus> well it's used a checksum in the kafka protocol so I can't deviate
14:15 < cainus> trying to write a kafka consumer
14:16 <@mscdex> kafka? the writer? :p
14:17 < cainus> kafka the lo-fi queuing/logging system
14:17 < cainus> ;)

14:27 <@Owner> no, it was never alive

14:35 <@jcrew> or hadoop, or any other number of things?
15:02 < chiel> hi guys, is it possible to get the directory where a script is located?
15:02 <@jcrew> chiel: __dirname
15:03 < chiel> jcrew: ah, is that a variable or a function?
15:03 <@jcrew> chiel: it's a variable 
15:04 < chiel> jcrew: cool, thank you
15:05 < chiel> jcrew: i don't suppose there's a similar var for cwd? :D
15:07 <@mscdex> process.cwd()
15:08 < chiel> mscdex: thanks! :)
15:15 < chiel> a dependancy i am using has some filesystem watching functionality, so i'd like to keep the my script alive until explicitly cancelled, is there a way to do that?
15:16 < chiel> my script seems to exit even if i don't use process.exit();
15:21 < milani> chiel, take a look at watchr module.
15:23 < chiel> milani: hmm, i can't seem to find that
15:23 < chiel> basically my script looks like this atm https://gist.github.com/6bcb26d0df5822b4f671
15:23 < chiel> i could trigger and endless while loop, but that seems rather disgusting, haha :D
15:24 < milani> chiel, just do npm install watchr
15:24 <@dscape> isaacs: working on domains in specify
15:24 <@dscape> how does this look? https://github.com/dscape/specify/compare/domains
15:25 < milani> chiel, http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watchfile_filename_options_listener
15:25 < chiel> milani: ah cool, thanks.
15:31 <@dscape> if we do npm install packagename, does it install latest or latest for current node version?
15:35 < Domenic> dscape: can you give an example of when there would be a difference?
15:43 < Guest72005> Do you have to open a new mysql connection before each query with node-mysql 2.0.0-alpha?
15:47 <@context> guest72005: id hope not.
15:57 < victusfate> heyo, for native modules, what's the best way to gain access to some c++11 features (or clang)? my environments are os x and ubuntu (needs to work on both)?
16:00 < chiel> hmm, on os x, isn't fs.watch() supposed to work for directories? it seems to work fine when i watch a file, but on directories it never fires the callback.
16:01 <@jcrew> oo i like the new npm site
16:02 < addisonj> yeah, the new site is nice... but I wonder what is up with search? is it just going to stay google search? I want some notion or popularity and/or recent releases in my search
16:03 <@jcrew> addisonj: yea i just saw that, my search is returning results that 404 on npmjs
16:06 <@shanse> chiel:you want a callback when a file within the directory changes or whenever the directory itself changes?
16:07 <@context> how does a directory itself change ?
16:07 < chiel> shanse, context: when anything inside the directory changes.
16:08 <@jcrew> chiel: you need to set up watchers for subdirectories
16:08 < chiel> could also be, for example, a directory or file being added (i imagine that might not be possible)
16:08 < chiel> jcrew: currently the directory I am watching has no subdirectories
16:08 < chiel> only files
16:08 < chiel> but it's never triggering the callback
16:08 <@jcrew> if something inside of a subdir changes and you want to capture that event, you need to set up a watcher for subdirs
16:08 <@context> chiel: fs.watch() ?
16:09 <@jcrew> chiel: lets see your code
16:11 <@jcrew> addisonj: it looks like for npm search you can do: /browse/keyword/{keyword} to get the old version of search
16:14 <@context> mmm fs.watch() is funny on OSX
16:14 <@context> filename always says null
16:14 <@context> and the event is always 'rename'
16:14 <@shanse> kqueue is funky
16:16 < chiel> context, jcrew: yeah i was using fs.watch, sec, lemme make a gist.
16:18 < chiel> context, jcrew: https://gist.github.com/f31837885028f38ab2df
16:19 < drudge> file will always be null on os x
16:19 < chiel> and yeah, filename is always null, but i only need to know if *anything* changed, so I can recompile :)
16:19 < chiel> like i said, if i watch a single file, it's all good, it triggers fine
16:20 < chiel> it always triggers twice though, for some reason
16:20 < chiel> but for directories, not a single time :p
16:20 <@context> chiel: well i do get a trigger anytime anything changed
16:22 < chiel> context: what version of os x are you on?
16:22 < chiel> I'm on 10.7
16:24 <@context> 10.8
16:25 <@isaacs> maxogden: i use that pattern a lot.  fs.createReadStream(tarball).pipe(zlib.Gunzip()).pipe(tar.Extract({path:'/foo/'})).on('end',cb).on('error',cb)
16:25 < chiel> context: hmm, could be it, I guess
16:25 <@isaacs> maxogden: like:  cat $tarball | gunzip | tar x -C /foo/
16:26 <@jcrew> chilts: if you're trying to monitor for code changes, you may want to use supervisor
16:26 <@jcrew> chiel: *
16:26 < timoxley> dscape installs latest depending on semver in your package.json. to get latest npm install module@latest
16:26 < chiel> jcrew: yeah, that is what i want exactly. :)
16:26 <@jcrew> i don't know if supervisor uses fs.watch but it lets you restart when your code changes
16:26 < chiel> hmm
16:26 <@context> chiel: heh, yeah use supervisor or similar. stop reinventing the wheel ;)
16:26 < chiel> jcrew: any link? :)
16:27 < chiel> context: hah, i am very new to node
16:27 < chiel> in fact, first time i use it.
16:27 <@jcrew> chiel: npm install -g supervisor
16:27 <@context> http://packagefinder1-enome.dotcloud.com/packages/show/supervisor
16:27 <@jcrew> and then instead of doing: node <script> you would do: supervisor <script>
16:27 < timoxley> chiel: `npm home supervisor` for homepage
16:28 < chiel> jcrew: i want to use supervisor from node though
16:28 < chiel> i want to watch my css files
16:28 < chiel> and recompile when stuff changes
16:28 < chiel> so maybe "code" changes isn't 100% accurate
16:29 <@jcrew> chiel: supervisor will handle that - if you've written a webserver and aren't too far down that path you could use express to serve static pages
16:30 < chiel> hmm, it's not a webserver. all i am trying to achieve is writing a script for while i am developing. i would turn it on, it watches my js + css directories, and compiles them when stuff changes
16:30 < chiel> that's literally all ^^
16:30 <@shanse> use supervisor or forever then
16:31 <@shanse> or nodemon
16:31 <@jcrew> chiel: yea any of what shanse mentioned would work for that
16:32 <@mscdex> use supervisor forever! ;->
16:32 < drudge> aww man RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
16:32 < chiel> jcrew, shanse: i'd still have to detect changes to the files within the file that supervisor/forever is monitoring though
16:32 < chiel> and that is the problem I have atm.
16:32 < chiel> unless i am a retard and completely misunderstanding what those thingies do.
16:32 < chiel> (entirely possible)
16:33 <@shanse> they can watch directories/files
16:33 <@shanse> and then execute/restart a script you specified
16:33 < distracteddev> chiel: You could have installed it and tried it out in the time it took you to ask these questions :p But yes, it should work recursively on all directories
16:34 < chiel> right lemme read some stuff.
16:34 <@jcrew> chiel: those apps will watch the directory you start your script from and automatically restart when a file is changed
16:35 < chiel> supervisor appears to be limited to .js files, unless the readme is out of date, i guess
16:36 <@Owner> does anyone know...how you are supposed to 'stream' data to an html5 audio component?  i am trying to add data to the element in chunks while its playing, but i get some skipping because each time you add data it apparently pauses and/or restarts from the beginning
16:37 <@shanse> chiel: you can specify extensions for supervisor
16:37 <@shanse> js is just the default
16:38 < chiel> fair enough
16:38 < timoxley> chiel another option is nodemon
16:38 < chiel> but i still think there's a misunderstanding and this doesn't entire do what i want it to
16:38 < chiel> this thing does process monitoring
16:38 < chiel> but that's not what i am after
16:39 < chiel> again, i may just be a retard, or stupid, or whatever :)
16:39 <@jcrew> chiel: just give it a shot, it will restart your script if you modify the script while it's running - you can specify other files for it to watch as well
16:39 < timoxley> chiel what exactly are you trying to do
16:40 < chiel> I have this project: https://github.com/chielkunkels/tinker-ui , I want to make a script that you can run while devving, that will watch css + js files for changes, and recompile when that happens
16:40 < chiel> i don't want it to detect changes in the js file that does the file watching
16:40 <@mscdex> Owner: have you tried chunked encoding when the player requests the stream?
16:41 < chiel> the project is frontend js, the only thing node would be the watcher script.
16:41 < chiel> so i am not trying to run a process.
16:41 <@Owner> mscdex~# im using binary websockets
16:41 <@mscdex> :S
16:41 < chiel> i just wanted to use fs.watch to monitor said directories
16:41 <@Owner> mscdex~# and...like createObjectURL iirc
16:41 < chiel> (which automatically keeps the process running anyway)
16:41 <@Owner> mscdex~# basically...new and improved data-uri
16:41 <@mscdex> Owner: can't you just have a source tag that points to an endpoint in your server that sends streaming data?
16:42 <@mscdex> or the javascript equivalent
16:42 <@mscdex> that's what i do
16:42 <@mscdex> i just let it get the stream through xhr or whatever the ua uses
16:43 <@mscdex> less overhead that way too i think
16:43 <@Owner> yeah, well i was assuming this is the future
16:43 < addisonj> I am suddenly unsure of something I used to know, node HTTP servers respect keep-alive by default since node v0.6, right?
16:44 <@Owner> guess ill use binary websockets for something else
16:45 <@mscdex> i use mediaelementjs on the frontend
16:45 <@mscdex> addisonj: i think so
16:46 < addisonj> thats what I thought, then I couldn't find the definite answer in the docs
16:46 < chiel> timoxley: sorry, didn't ping you when i answered, answer is just up there ^
16:47 < timoxley> chiel grunt
16:47 < timoxley> chiel grunt designed exactly for that use-case
16:48 < chiel> timoxley: hmm ok, gonna look at it. :)
16:50 < timoxley> chiel docs are a little daunting. https://gist.github.com/3188184 is an example gruntfile in coffeescript. straight js version below it.
16:50 < timeturne> anyone have a single page app without backbone?
16:51 <@shanse> true, totally forgot about grunt
16:51 < timeturne> just using a client-side router and an ajax lib
16:51 < chakrit_> how do you specify a dylib dependency in binding.gyp? any pointers?
16:52 < chiel> timoxley: hmm alright thanks, I'll have a look at it. :)
16:52 < chiel> my usecase is so very simple though, just annoying that fs.watch is not working for me
16:52 < chiel> that is literally the *only* issue i am facing :p
16:52 <@jcrew> haven't heard of grunt, that looks pretty cool
16:52 < timoxley> chiel grunt = simple
16:53 < timoxley> timeturne try page.js or director + superagent or one of these http://microjs.com/#ajax
16:54 < timeturne> yeah that's what I was thinking about. was just looking for some example code since I'm trying to figure out if it ends up looking like backbone or if backbone is really overkill
16:54 < timoxley> timeturne backbone doesn't give you much
16:55 < timoxley> every time I start a project without backbone, I end up building backbone and then scrapping it and just using backbone
16:55 < RLa> hm, uml cannot express closures, oh fail
16:55 < deedubs> timoxley: have you taken a look at angular?
16:56 <@Owner> NODE DOT JAY ESS
16:56 <@mscdex> chakrit_: i think you specify dylibs in your sources list
16:56 < timoxley> deedubs not properly. looks good. tried ember. ember not ready.
16:56 < timeturne> so it's probably better to start with backbone I guess. probably should replace backbone's ajax function and router with superagent and page
16:56 < owen1> can anyone explain in simple words wwhat generators (shallow continuations) and fibers (deep continuations) are?
16:58 < timoxley> timeturne let me know how you go on the ajax front, haven't used backbone without jquery ajax before
16:58 <@mscdex> backbone to the rescue!
16:59 <@shanse> that's one thing I need to try as well
16:59 <@shanse> replace jquery in my backbone apps
16:59 <@mscdex> with zepto?
16:59 <@shanse> that would be a start

17:20 <@AAA_awright> * fs, net, http, require, url, crypto, path, dns, util
17:20 <@AAA_awright> * REPL
17:20 <@AAA_awright> * EventEmitter

17:24 <@AAA_awright> So I think from that we can scrap all of the build system, npm, much of v8, zlib, the blog posts (seriously wtf)
17:24 < timeturne> lol
17:25 < timeturne> yeah I have no idea why npm is part of node
17:25 < RLa> i think it's in separate repo
17:26 < Domenic> But isaacs likes checking in dependencies
17:26 <@AAA_awright> It's checked into the node.js core.
17:26 < Domenic> He does the same for npm-www
17:26 < timeturne> yeah
17:26 < timeturne> there should be no checking in
17:26 <@AAA_awright> Like, seriously, wtf
17:26 < timeturne> but the blog posts in node's repo pisses me off
17:26 < Domenic> I am happy to defer to his experience, he's the one who maintains large projects, not me.
17:27 <@AAA_awright> It's large because people make it that way O_O
17:27 <@AAA_awright> Node.js is a dead simple project. It compiles in 15 seconds flat on any modern computer.
17:27 < jhsto> sup guys
17:27 < timeturne> 15 seconds?
17:27 < jhsto> does anyone know way to allocate a specific task to GPU?
17:28 < timeturne> it takes me at least 1-2 mins :(
17:28 < timeturne> maybe I'm doing something wrong
17:28 <@AAA_awright> If you disable shared v8, v8 takes up like 95% of the build time
17:28 <@AAA_awright> Actually you have to explicitly enable --shared-v8
17:28 <@mscdex> AAA_awright: my experience is that openssl takes a good chunk of the time now
17:28 < TooTallNate> AAA_awright: with openssl bundled by default, that takes up a lot of the build time now
17:28 <@mscdex> heh
17:29 < TooTallNate> damn, brian beat me
17:29 <@AAA_awright> I think I use shared openssl too
17:29 <@AAA_awright> Point is, ALL of the dependencies take a longer time to compile than Node.js proper
17:29 < timeturne> "shared" meaning?
17:29 < RLa> wow, new eclipse looks ugly
17:29 <@mscdex> i'd prefer the sources for the dependencies to be included with node
17:29 <@AAA_awright> Use the OS libraries, don't compile your own
17:30 < RLa> AAA_awright, i think you can pass flags to configure to use shared libs
17:30 < RLa> you can share v8 too
17:30 < jhsto> so guys
17:30 < jhsto> any method to allocate a task to gpu?
17:31 < timeturne> so ./configure --shared-v8 ?
17:31 <@AAA_awright> $ ./configure --openssl-use-sys --shared-zlib --shared-v8 --without-npm
17:31 <@AAA_awright> $ time make -j5
17:31 <@AAA_awright> real 0m10.308s/user 0m28.998s/sys 0m3.208s
17:31 <@mscdex> jhsto: https://github.com/kashif/node-cuda https://github.com/fifield/node-webcl https://github.com/softwarekollektiv/node-opencl
17:32 < jhsto> damn, thanks mscdex
17:32 < timeturne> that's beautiful
17:32 <@AAA_awright> 10 seconds flat guys
17:32 <@mscdex> there is no building for npm, so why exclude it?
17:32 <@AAA_awright> ... 10.3 seconds flat
17:32 <@AAA_awright> 10 seconds
17:33 <@AAA_awright> mscdex: I don't want it on my system :p
17:33 < timeturne> so we would need to have v8, openssl, and zlib compiled and installed only once and then node can just use them from the OS
17:33 <@AAA_awright> Well I use V8 for MongoDB as well, and that uses all those, so it's free
17:33 <@mscdex> timeturne: and then complain on the issue tracker when your system's v8 gets out of sync with node's v8 usage
17:33 <@mscdex> ;-)
17:34 < timeturne> yeah that's what I was thinking
17:34 <@AAA_awright> I've never had a problem
17:34 < marshall> hey node
17:34 <@mscdex> having a fixed environment solves a lot of tech support headaches
17:35 <@AAA_awright> The point is supposed to be how Node.js is a tiny fraction of the build time people see
17:35 <@mscdex> you build once though
17:35 <@mscdex> it's not that problematic
17:35 < marshall> how do I test for the error type when dealing with native error objects?
17:35 <@AAA_awright> ... that Node.js is a really tiny project compared to everything else out there. It's just a set of libraries for V8.
17:35 <@mscdex> especially when packages are available for your favorite linux distro
17:36 <@AAA_awright> And that there's no reason it should be as bloated as it is.
17:36 < marshall> catch(e){console.log(e.type)} doesn't work when dealing with SyntaxError objects
17:37 <@Garrick> Was there a change in NPM's install.sh path? I'm getting "sh: line 1: moved:: command not found" when running curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
17:37 < timeturne> basically it's to prevent the same noob issues from popping up on the issue tracker. when everything is bundled it eliminates a lot of the dependency issues
17:38 <@AAA_awright> I agree linking to a particular commit is a good thing
17:38 <@AAA_awright> That's why I use git submodules and not revision numbers for my module dependencies
17:39 <@mscdex> oh no, not git submodules again ;-)
17:39 <@AAA_awright> That said, I don't think my practice of linking to the shared v8 library should ever cause any problems, you *should* see them right away, at compile-time, if there's any issues, or it's a bug with v8 itself
17:40 <@AAA_awright> I like linking to specific commits, and I like actually using whatever version you like, if people correctly use semver or some other scheme to match comparible APIs together (even if it introduces problems from time to time)
17:40 <@mscdex> AAA_awright: then you have to rely on your distro providing a compatible v8 release for node to work properly
17:41 <@mscdex> AAA_awright: otherwise you have to compile yourself, which you may as well do in the first place
17:41 <@AAA_awright> I'm usually always up-to-date on v8, seeing as Gentoo compiles it for Chromium and for MongoDB
17:42 <@mscdex> maybe you are, but lots of users are on distros like Ubuntu that generally have stale versions in their repos
17:42 <@AAA_awright> And they probably have stale Node.js too
17:42 <@AAA_awright> They can die a painful, obsolete death
17:43 <@mscdex> not if they're compiling from source ;-)
17:43 <@AAA_awright> True
17:43 < DTrejo> isaacs: can we obfuscate the emails on npmjs.org?
17:43 <@isaacs> DTrejo: why?
17:43 <@isaacs> DTrejo: it's not as if they're obfuscated in teh registry.
17:43 <@mscdex> spammity calamity!
17:43 < DTrejo> just so spambots don't scrape the site and then email us
17:43 <@isaacs> mscdex: oh ones!
17:43 <@isaacs> DTrejo: they already do.
17:43 <@mscdex> dun dun dunnn
17:44 <@isaacs> DTrejo: they are signed up for the mailing lists, and then are capable of parsing every obfuscation mechanism.
17:44 < DTrejo> I guess, but people don't read the json in the registry I feel like
17:44 <@AAA_awright> What's Node.js currently on? I'm linking to libv8.so.3.10.8 on my server, libv8.so.3.12.11 on my desktop
17:44 <@isaacs> DTrejo: your feelings are not a spambot :)
17:44 < DTrejo> haha fine
17:44 <@isaacs> DTrejo: if you wanted to scrape the site, you could just look at http://isaacs.iriscouch.com/public_users/_all_docs?include_docs=true
17:45 <@AAA_awright> mscdex: Also, I've begun explaining some of my theory in http://magnode.org/nodejs-design-demantics
17:45 <@isaacs> DTrejo: or http://registry.npmjs.org/-/users
17:45 < DTrejo> yeah but spammers dont scrape site by site, they probably have crawlers that do it
17:45 < DTrejo> so they won't find links that humans wouldnt find
17:45 <@isaacs> yeah, and those crawlers can de-obfuscate.
17:45 <@isaacs> those crawlers can solve the less-extremely-insane captchas, even, so using images is no solution either.
17:45 <@isaacs> the only solution is to block spam at your mail service.
17:46 < DTrejo> the other solution would be to add a honeypot link with visibility hidden, and then ban the IP when it visits
17:46 <@isaacs> or make spam less profitable by jailing spammers.
17:46 <@isaacs> DTrejo: no, we'd just ban everyone from any ISP that does the helpful prefetching thing
17:46 <@isaacs> DTrejo: aka, every mobile user ever
17:46 < DTrejo> who needs em
17:46 <@isaacs> you're about 20 years too late to solve this problem, i'm afraid.
17:46 < DTrejo> lol
17:47 <@isaacs> email address have been public almost forever.
17:47 <@isaacs> if you don't like it, make a new email address just for this purpose, and use that.
17:47 <@isaacs> the much worse problem is "I signed up for your thing but I didn't realize it and now I can't parse the boolean option logic to not stop missing out on not receiving your valuable offers from valuable partners"
17:48 <@isaacs> or clicking the unsubscribe link, then having to enter your email address again, then confirming, then waiting 48 hours for it to take effect.
17:49  * isaacs usually just blocks senders the first time a 'unsubscribe' is not immediate
17:49 <@mscdex> i block all incoming emails that don't have the phrase "node.js rules" somewhere in the subject line or body

18:17 < timoxley> lucidity14 can you gist the errors?
18:17 < nickhs> Hey all, I have somewhat confusing use case. I have a bot that post an image to an express server, I then need a human to take a look at the image, tell me what it contains and send that response back to the bot. What would be the best way to do that?
18:17 <+Owner> nickhs~# DIE SPAMMER
18:18 < nickhs> Owner: excuse me?

18:19 <@prettyrobots> timeturner: I believe Owner is a bot.
18:19 <@prettyrobots> The only thing that would make him happier would be to erdaicate humans a little bit.
18:20 <@prettyrobots> Which, well, I'm up for that.
18:20 <@prettyrobots> *not*
18:20 <@timeturner> haha
18:20 <@prettyrobots> *Not* up for that.
18:20 < nickhs> prettyrobots: I'm aware of the service :D, but this more from an architectural point of view. So the express server receives a post to /image with the picture, how do I show that image on another route for human inference and respond to the post request with the result?

18:27 < timoxley> lucidity14 that's not where you installed node is it
18:28 < timoxley> lucidity14 you just followed those instructions
18:28 < timoxley> shoudl be fine
18:28 < timoxley> hm
18:28 < timoxley> lucidity14 tried again?
18:28 < lucidity14> timoxley: i doubt it - the ubuntu packages puts the nodejs exec in /usr/bin/nodejs
18:28 < milani> prettyrobots, everyone here in #Node.js
18:28 < milani> :)
18:28 < lucidity14> timoxley: tried a few times.. i'm at the point where i'm going to try compiling from source instead of using the ubuntu repos
18:29 < timoxley> lucidity14 good idea
18:29 < prettyrobots> milani: Sweet.
18:29 <@Owner> lucidity14~# that is easier....
18:29 <@Owner> lucidity14~# use nvm and dont install anything global at all
18:29 < lucidity14> Owner: arguably, the repos are easier ;) but it might introduce some undresired problems
18:29 <@gkatsev> how old is the node.js package on the ubuntu repos?
18:29 < lucidity14> Owner: nvm? or npm?
18:29 <@Owner> nvm
18:30 < prettyrobots> lucidity14: Compile from source.
18:30 < lucidity14> gkatsev: the package version is 0.8.4-1chl1~precise1
18:30 <@Owner> very easy
18:30 <@context> gkatsev: im sure you can find a release history
18:30 < timoxley> lucidity14 nvm/nave/n are all node version managers
18:30 < prettyrobots> lucidity14: I always install to '/opt' as me. 
18:30 <@gkatsev> oh, I guess it was updated. Is someone maintaining it?
18:30 <@context> gkatsev: there is an apt repo you can add to Ubuntu to get a newer version as well

18:44 <@slickplaid> you'll never be able to get that to work like that without a botnet
18:44 <@gkatsev> Owner: well, you could forward the port or something.
18:44 <@whiskers75> Owner: cloud9 supports SSH workspaces :P
18:44 <@slickplaid> probably will need <4 times the operation limit on the ircd to have that work fast enough to kick before deopping all your bots
18:44 <@AAA_awright> I think those bots should join with random usernames from different hosts, and emit some sort of code language to let the others know that they're going to protect each other
18:44 <@AAA_awright> And you have 16 of them on the channel at once
18:45 <@slickplaid> err >4 times the operation limit in bots
18:45 <@AAA_awright> And in a channel with 250 operators you'd never notice them
18:45 -!- mode/#node.js [+o AAA_awright] by Owner
18:45 <@slickplaid> that's the only way :D
18:45 <@whiskers75> no :)
18:45 <@AAA_awright> And they part and join randomly every so often
18:45 <@AAA_awright> So you just have no clue
18:45 <@Owner> random names...do not seem very random in a lot of cases
18:46 <@Owner> if it scraped names perhaps
18:46 <@slickplaid> all bots need to have a unique ip, too
18:46 <@slickplaid> otherwise, one ban can squelch them all
18:46 <@whiskers75> you can code it if you want: github.com/whiskers75/IRC-bot
18:46 <@whiskers75> pull request :)
18:46 <@whiskers75> gtg
18:46 <@Owner> wow you have a github account?
18:46 <@Owner> im jealous
18:47 < sent-hil> are there any problems for nodejs on xcode 4.4?
18:47 <@nlf> sent-hil: nope
18:47 < sent-hil> err i mean osx-gcc-installer
18:47 < sent-hil> ** NOTE: Currently, Node.js is having issues building with osx-gcc-installer. The only fix is to install Xcode over osx-gcc-installer.
18:48 < sent-hil> I got the above warning when installing ruby with rvm
18:48 <@maxogden> why would a ruby thing mention node
18:48 < whiskers75> back
18:49 < sent-hil> I think b/c they're asking to install the osx-gcc-installer
18:49 <@nlf> oh, yeah i don't know
18:49 < whiskers75> opme
18:49 -!- mode/#node.js [+o whiskers75] by IRCbot_Master
18:49 <@nlf> i just installed xcode 4.4, then the command line tools
18:49 <@nlf> used my free developer account
18:49 <@nlf> then off it went and everything's happy
18:49 <@whiskers75> nlf: xcode?
18:50 <@whiskers75> why xcode? what are you doing
18:50 <@whiskers75> node for iOS?
18:50 <@whiskers75> ;)
18:50 < sent-hil> hmm, this mountain lion update is turning into a nightmare
18:50 <@nlf> xcode isn't just for ios
18:50 <@whiskers75> ok mac then
18:50 <@Owner> sent-hil~# try linux
18:50 < deedubs> sent-hil: yes it was quite painful to update
18:51 <@nlf> i use it for quite a few things, but mostly because it's far less hassle to install xcode and the command line tools than use the osx-gcc-installer
18:51 <@Owner> linux also has DE's that dont blow if you care about that sort of thing
18:51 <@whiskers75> you are lucky you can update, sent-hil 
18:51 < sent-hil> i came from ubuntu, tired of all the little tweaks
18:51 <@Owner> ubuntu isn't linux according to their website
18:51 <@Owner> fwiw
18:51 < sent-hil> don't be so lucky, my entire ruby setup is broken :(
18:51 < sent-hil> *feel
18:51 <@whiskers75> it is a DERIVATIVE of it
18:52 <@whiskers75> well, a fork of Debian, which is a fork of Linux
18:52 <@gkatsev> there is no linux anyway. It's GNU/linux :
18:52 <@Owner> debian and linux are part of the UBUNTU ecosystem
18:52 <@gkatsev> P
18:52 <@gkatsev> :P
18:53 <@whiskers75> gkatsev: P (no eyes? poor
18:53 <@whiskers75> emote!)
18:53 <@gkatsev> whiskers75: it got separated
18:54 < sent-hil> nlf: isn't command line tools same as osx-gcc-installer
18:54 <@whiskers75> oh no! :) (at least this one is intact)
18:54 <@nlf> sent-hil: roughly, but less hacky
18:54 <@nlf> osx-gcc-installer basically takes the xcode package and pulls only specific files from it
18:55 <@whiskers75> why are we talking mac here?
18:55 < sent-hil> ah ok
18:55 <@gkatsev> whiskers75: installing node on mac is a valid thing to talk in a node channel
18:55 <@whiskers75> oh
18:55 < darinc> use nvm!
18:55 <@nlf> and yeah, sent-hil: i'd suggest using nvm or nave or something similar to install node
18:55 <@gkatsev> though, doesn't node have a dmg you can use?
18:55 <@Owner> nvm should be the recommended install method
18:55 < darinc> http://www.aaronfoltz.com/blog/2011/08/24/node-version-manage-nvm-on-mac-os-x/
18:56 < darinc> nvm rocks.  I gave a presentation on it at my company.
18:56 <@nlf> i hacked it up a little
18:56 -!- whiskers75 changed the topic of #Node.js to: The official Node.js (nodejs.org) support channel
18:56 <@nlf> i was irritated at the inconsistent use of v in the versions
18:56 <@nlf> also added an ls-remote command
18:56 <@whiskers75> nvm? isnt that ruby?
18:57 <@nlf> rvm is ruby
18:57 <@nlf> nvm is node
18:57 <@nlf> well, it's a bash script, but it's for installing node
18:57 <@whiskers75> oh 
18:57 <@whiskers75> Node version manager?
18:57 <@nlf> yes
18:58 <@Owner> whiskers75~# lay off the coffee
18:58 <@whiskers75> my IRC client has ads GRRRR
18:58 <@whiskers75> and Owner im just a node newbie
18:59 <@context> whiskers75: im a fan of colloquy on iOS
18:59 <@whiskers75> imagine: opeverybody
18:59 <@whiskers75> i use mango, only free client out there
18:59 < jrajav> I thought Colloquy was fine until I found Textual
19:00 < sent-hil> Typing this from limechat
19:00 < jrajav> I gotta be honest, for a lot of things on Mac you either gotta shell out some cash, or deal with crap/ads/both
19:00 <@context> but mango does look nice
19:00 <@context> if it didnt have ads
19:00 <@whiskers75> yeah
19:00 <@Owner> jrajav~# you just noticed?
19:00 <@context> $2 > ads
19:00 <@whiskers75> context, and it CRASHES ARGGGH
19:01 <@context> than its useless.
19:01 <@whiskers75> context, and the ads are all the app creator's (dumb money plan)
19:01 <@slickplaid> i think i'd probably build a botnet with a distributed control system using tcp sockets, or possibly just have them join a channel on the ircd to control... but depends on how much you trust the ircd
19:02 <@whiskers75> botnet?!
19:02 <@whiskers75> are there any other free IRC clients?
19:02 <@Owner> http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xchat-azure/id447521961
19:02 <@slickplaid> yeah, it's what you'd need to keep your bots from being deopped/banned
19:02 <@Owner> apple....i cant wait till they die
19:02 <@Owner> look at that crap
19:02 <@slickplaid> their communication would have to be faster than the ircd
19:02 <@whiskers75> owner: that free?
19:02 <@Owner> yes
19:03 < jrajav> whiskers75: You can always use irssi or weechat in iTerm or something
19:03 <@slickplaid> meaning they'd need to communicate between themselves faster than a person could deop
19:03 <@whiskers75> iSSH CRASHES
19:03 < jrajav> whiskers75: Other than that, I can personally attest that most free clients suck
19:03 <@Owner> free except the fact that you have to look at APPLE brainwashing plastered all over the download site
19:03 <@whiskers75> this is jailbroken >;)
19:04 <@whiskers75> ill go check that client out
19:04 < jrajav> Owner: Bit of a chip on your shoulder with Apple? P
19:04 <@Owner> whiskers75~# uhh i dont think it works on mobile
19:05 <@Owner> jrajav~# yeah...im not buying it, they are not fooling me at all
19:05 <@Owner> im allergic to kool-aid
19:05 < jrajav> Not buying what? A Mac?
19:05 <@slickplaid> and given that there's a limit to the amount of people/bots you can affect per command, you'd have to a) increase the amount of bots to greater than the command limit and b) create communication between the bots to correlate the deops/kicks/bans for greatest efficiency... the amount of bots inversely correlational with the speed of which the communication needs to happen (meaning, if you have 
19:05 <@slickplaid> more bots, the greater time you have to respond... if it's a single person deopping and not a whole 'nother botnet doing the deops)
19:05 <@whiskers75> jrajav: the jailbreak?
19:05 <@Owner> anything they are selling
19:06 < timoxley> Owner ah so you're drinking the anti-apple kool-aid instead
19:06 < jrajav> No one's making you.
19:06 < timoxley> a fine choice
19:06 <@whiskers75> i am not anti apple
19:06 <@Owner> timoxley~# no
19:06 <@whiskers75> just i think jailbreaking improves iOS
19:07 <@Owner> same with ubuntu, facebook, twitter, etc anything shoved down peoples throats as if its the messiah, its trash.  marketting is a sign of weakness
19:07 < jrajav> Personally I think OS X is far and away the best end-user OS available, and has some of the best software. The hardware's overpriced, but it's still high quality.
19:07 < jrajav> All in all I think it's worth the price
19:07 <@Owner> jrajav~# osx is a piece
19:07 < janmower_> i'm back on linux after suffering a year and a half of osx fwiw
19:08 <@slickplaid> so given that you can't control how many malicious people are in the channel to deop people/bots, faster communication is the key
19:08 < jrajav> It's all subjective, but it's just as silly to knock it as it is to worship it. It's all a personal choice
19:08 < timoxley> ^
19:08 < janmower_> os x network stack is unreliable enough to be a daily problem
19:08 <@Owner> the worship is what is causing all the ripples through all of IT
19:08 <@whiskers75> go linux - ubuntu
19:08 <@Owner> because apple made some crap product and brainwashe dpeople, now we get Windows 8
19:08 < jrajav> janmower_: I would never use OS X to host a server.
19:08 < janmower_> pity, it's pretty nice looking, 3d is a shitshow
19:08 < jrajav> janmower_: I specifically said end-user OS
19:08 <@wookiehangover> I discriminate against anyone who has different opinions than me
19:08 <@Owner> and we get kde4 and gnome 3 and firefox 99
19:08 <@Owner> all looking like apple garbage
19:08 <@wookiehangover> obviously
19:08 < janmower_> yea end user linux is preferable to me
19:09 < ovaillancourt> whiskers75: slightly late, but check out Limechat -> http://limechat.net/mac/
19:09 < timoxley> I mean, I preferred it when we didn't have touch-screen phones, or tablets life was a lot simpler
19:09 < janmower_> i think os x is too frustrating on a daily basis
19:09 <@whiskers75> im on an ipod
19:09 < janmower_> apt-get install "awesomesauce"
19:09 <@whiskers75> and a freeby guy
19:09 < janmower_> iso shelling out cash on an app store i don't trust
19:09 <@whiskers75> awesomesauce? is that even in the Ubuntu repos? ;)
19:10 < jrajav> Apple's "ripples" also caused Android, which I'm pretty happy with
19:10 < janmower_> whiskers75: oh yea its everything that's there
19:10 <@whiskers75> install homebrew (github.com/mxcl/homebrew) for mac
19:10 < jrajav> It's pretty unfair to blame Windows 8 on Apple though :P
19:10 < janmower_> homebrew is a frustrating pos
19:10 <@Owner> jrajav~# lol
19:10 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: check this out: http://smalldata.org:8080/
19:10 < janmower_> yea reinstall ssl before it's fully baked
19:10 <@whiskers75> well at least its SOMETHING
19:10 <@whiskers75> id like apt though
19:11 < janmower_> apple should be doing homebrew
19:11 < janmower_> not leaning on the free software freaks 
19:11 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: working on upload progress but if you drop a shapefile on that page it will stream it to node and then stream you back a csv
19:11 < jrajav> Apple? Supporting a command line package manager?
19:11 < jrajav> ell oh ell, sir
19:11 < janmower_> homebrew would be a better experience if apple did it
19:11 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: lemme link you to an example shapefile 
19:11 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: here are some http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Overlays/shapefiles/
19:12 < christoffe> Nice job Maxogden
19:12 <@whiskers75> how about Apple Package Manager (apm) ? 
19:12 <@Owner> honestly apple products are not designed for technical people...so why dumb yourself down trying to use such a closed system
19:12 <@whiskers75> make that apple
19:12 <@whiskers75> Owner: well if you jailbreak...
19:12 <@Owner> installing shoutcast on osx should not make you feel like a super hacker, nor should you have to pay money
19:13 <@Owner> hence, use an os that doesnt put up walls
19:13 <@whiskers75> i dont use OSX
19:13 <@whiskers75> i use Ubuntu 12.04 
19:13 <@whiskers75> but I use iOS
19:13 < cris_> anyone had any luck deploying node canvas to ubuntu with stagecoach
19:14 <@Owner> whiskers75~# I am also a retard, let us be friends!

19:15 <@Owner> how is using ios not a waste of your time
19:15 <@whiskers75> because it is jailbroken
19:15 <@whiskers75> source of salvation
19:15 <@Owner> how is it not a waste of your time
19:16 <@whiskers75> well, it just makes things easier
19:16 <@Owner> my original iphone is jailbroken...and i have a full build stack, php, lighttpd, tor, etc on it...still a waste of my time
19:16 <@Owner> perhaps fun...but
19:16 <@whiskers75> and when jailbroken makes it a tiny computer
19:16 <@Owner> you are going to get more done on a more open system
19:16 <@whiskers75> yes you are
19:16 <@whiskers75> though
19:17 <@Owner> you should not feel like a 'leet hax0r' because you can use an iphone like a computer...that means you should probably just use a real computer
19:17 < gicode> Is there any reason socket.io doesn't default to a signed cookie-type store?
19:17 <@maxogden> can you argue about node instead of whatever you are arguing about right now?

19:21 <@whiskers75> asdfmovie remix: i like node 
19:21 <@Owner> i havent done anything with cookies
19:21 <@Owner> you can use socket.set to set data
19:21 < gicode> Owner: How does redis session expiry work?
19:21 <@Owner> gicode~# i have not used it
19:22 <@Owner> i havent done anything with 'cookies' and socket.io
19:22 <@wookiehangover> maxogden: that's pretty hott
19:22 < gicode> Owner: You use Redis though? That is what I am asking...
19:22 <@Owner> no, i do not
19:23 < gicode> Owner: Ah, OK.  Well then, no Redis support is not enough. ;-)
19:23 <@whiskers75> its wierd that nodester can host IRC bots

19:25 < whiskers75> whose bot is it?
19:26 <@slickplaid> RSA/FBI
19:26 <@Owner> pretty much
19:27 < rektide> i knew the IRC5 working group was up to no good
19:27 < whiskers75> FBI?
19:27 < rektide> the bots are listening in on our real world conversations now
19:27 < whiskers75> really...
19:27 < whiskers75> ?
19:27 < rektide> yes definitely
19:27 <@Owner> do not vocalize
19:28 < rektide> Node is of the most vital national security
19:28 <@Owner> problem solved

19:28 < darinc> IRCLogger was written in Sinatra, an awesome Ruby microframework. The source code is available on GitHub.
19:28 < darinc> check out irclogger.com
19:28 < rektide> it's cool though
19:29 < rektide> slurp is node powered
19:29 < rektide> nooooo did someone kick slurp

19:35 <@Owner> nah, im organizing a ddos
19:35 <@context> owner: thats like getting mad and ddos'ing facebook cause your friend posted a pic of you being a complete retard last weekend
19:37 <@jcrew> i'm going to put that conversation on the interweb pipes
19:37 < whiskers75> it already is jcrew
19:38 < whiskers75> irclogger.com
19:39 < whiskers75> i think node want to have IRC logs
19:40 < whiskers75> ok lets talk about node now
19:40 < prettyrobots> I like node because it always noticies when I get a haircut.
19:40 < whiskers75> :?
19:41 <@slickplaid> .
19:41 < prettyrobots> Your turn whiskers75 !
19:41 <@wookiehangover> maxogden: curious what motivated you to use shapefiles... they seem really interesting but I hadn't ever dealt with the format before
19:41 < rymate1234> hey
19:41 < rymate1234> so I'm messing around with node.js
19:41 < rymate1234> having a couple issues with jade
19:41 < whiskers75> prettyrobots: ?
19:41 < prettyrobots> You said you wanted to talk about node.
19:42 < whiskers75> yes, but... about node problems
19:42 < rymate1234> Here''s my jade files
19:42 < rymate1234> http://pastebin.com/DSp9ceqA
19:43 < rymate1234> Problem is I can't seem to get my sidebar displaying anything
19:43 < whiskers75> im off for now
19:43 < prettyrobots> wookiehangover: Shape files are from ESRI. It's where maps come from.
19:44 < prettyrobots> What's maxogden using them for?
19:44 <@wookiehangover> prettyrobots: http://smalldata.org:8080/
19:44 < prettyrobots> Nice.
19:44 <@context> whats .shp :x
19:44 < prettyrobots> So...
19:44 <@Owner> no one has ever heard of .shp
19:44 < prettyrobots> wookiehangover: maxogden must be liberatiing out datatas.
19:45 < prettyrobots> wookiehangover: maxogden must be liberating our datas.
19:45 <@context> File extension: SHP
19:45 <@context> File type: 3D Modeling
19:45 < prettyrobots> Shapefiles are a file format for GIS.
19:45 <@context> 3D Studio by AutoDesk, ArcView, AutoCAD, etc etc
19:45 <@Owner> what about ArcGIS
19:46 < prettyrobots> Census 2010 parish, tract, block group and block geographies joined with total population, population by race, and housing occupancy data.  These files are formatted as shapefiles for use in GIS software (download is a zipped file).    A methodology paper describing the RPC process of downloading and formatting categorical names and of summarizing race data is available with each download.  
19:46 < prettyrobots> http://www.norpc.org/
19:46 <@context> Clarion, ESRI GIS, GIS, and surprisingly
19:46 < prettyrobots> For example.
19:46 <@context> Command & Conquer uses this file extension as well
19:46 <@Owner> good ole ESRI
19:47 < prettyrobots> The reason small data is useful is that there's a lot of government data locked up in ESRI.
19:48 < rymate1234> so what's my issue?
19:48 < prettyrobots> rymate1234: Your issue is that no one here cares about Jade, I guess.
19:49 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: my gf needed to convert shapefiles yesterday and it prompted me to write that app. im gonna add more formats in the future, just setting up the framework now
19:49 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: ESRI is the MSFT of the mapping world
19:49 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: pretty common inside government
19:49 < rymate1234> oh
19:49 < rymate1234> lol
19:50 <@wookiehangover> maxogden: interesting
19:50 < prettyrobots> What the? What have I been saying?
19:50 <@maxogden> wookiehangover: but basically i'm writing a thing to convert binary data between two formats
19:50 < rymate1234> but this is the official node.js support channel! (and the only place I can think to ask!)
19:51 < prettyrobots> Try the mailing list. Gives people time to find you.
19:52 <@Owner> maxogden~# how did you find the shape file format details?
19:53 <@maxogden> Owner: wat
19:53 <@Owner> where is the binary data specification for the shape file format
19:53 < prettyrobots> Well, you could use Google for that. http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf
19:54 <@Owner> oh thanks, never heard of google
19:54 <@maxogden> if you read the code on github you'd see i didnt reverse engineer the protocol :)

20:44 <@txm> out of interest .. how would you get an app to listen on a protected port without root?
20:44 <@timeturner> txm: you start the process as root, bind to the port and then drop privileges
20:45 <+Niloc> authbind ftw
20:45 < whiskers75> try deopping the master bit ;)
20:45 < whiskers75> bot
20:46 <@Aikar> txm: one option is to bind to non privledged port, then use iptables to forward privledged port to unprivledged
20:46 <@timeturner> let me guess, slave automatically re-ops master then de-ops person who de-opped master
20:46 < whiskers75> nope
20:46 < whiskers75> try it
20:46 <@txm> server.listen(serverPort, function() {
20:46 <@txm>   process.setgid(nodeUserGid);
20:46 <@txm>   process.setuid(nodeUserUid);
20:46 <@txm> });
20:46 <@Aikar> txm: i personally like that open, no privledge escalation needed at all for startup
20:46 <@timeturner> txm: yep
20:47 <@Aikar> option *
20:47 <@timeturner> txm: don't be afraid to start from root, just remember to drop priviliges and you'll be fine

20:51 <@whiskers75> HAHAHAHA
20:51 <@whiskers75> or just have 100 bots
20:51 <@flexd> how about none? :D
20:51 <+Niloc> it's 2012 and whiskers75 thinks he's inventing takeover protection *facepalm*

20:52 <@flexd> The ultimate takeover protection... the g-line :(
20:52 <@flexd> https://github.com/idottv/express-cache-control/blob/master/cache.js Does that look fairly reasonable? I just want cache-control headers so varnish caches stuff hm
20:53 <@whiskers75> i know - when you -oo the bots, they add you as their nemesis - abd then they kick you when reopped
20:53 <@jayne> bots that hold a grudge. what could _possible_ go wrong with that?

21:01 <@flexd> AnonymousPrime: Windowns?
21:01 <@flexd> Windows*
21:02 <@flexd> or, I guess that is not implied.. I just figured since you specified 64bit like that :p
21:02 < AnonymousPrime> flexd most immeidately yes, at my day job, but i guess same question applies at home for the mac
21:02 <@flexd> I would think they all work with 64bit, but I do not know. 
21:02 < AnonymousPrime> or is there just 64 bit for win?

21:40 < whiskers75> They will, bux will put them up
21:40 <@Nexxy> no, they won't
21:40 < DTrejo> and they will be banned again
21:40 < whiskers75> oh
21:40 <@Nexxy> they are banned, it's all good
21:40 < jerrysv> heya DTrejo - have a sec?
21:40 < Domenic> This Bux character sounds like it's in need of a banning
21:40 <@Nexxy> Domenic, they're just learning
21:40 <@Nexxy> it's ok
21:41 < monad> NO FUN
21:41 < Domenic> OK fine I'll calm down :P

21:42 < flexd> Colors and bold on IRC
21:42 < rymate1234> THIS STATEMENT IS FALSE
21:42 < whiskers75> why did ChanServ takeover?
21:42 < flexd> I thought the +mode for that was default on all IRC channels since like the 90's :D
21:42 < flexd> to block that*
21:42 < flexd> whiskers75: because Nexxy told it to deopp everyone :)
21:42 <@Nexxy> actually that wasn't me
21:42 < whiskers75> hey!
21:42 < whiskers75> then who did
21:43 < whiskers75> well Nexxy wasnt deopped

21:46 < monad> powa
21:46 < trb> I have my own irc servers for that
21:46 < whiskers75> why unban my bots?
21:46 < monad> with 0 ppl on them
21:46 < trb> where I can iptables block peeps if I hate them
21:46 <@Nexxy> whiskers75, those were old masks

21:56 < DTrejo> evaded my question
21:57 <@isaacs> hey, go click around on npmjs.org
21:57 <@isaacs> https://npmjs.org/
21:57 <@isaacs> click all the links
21:57 <@isaacs> sign in, do stuff
21:57 < flexd> it's a trap?

21:58 < ovaillancourt> :P
21:58 < flexd> Edited my profile :)
21:58 <@isaacs> sweet
21:58 <@isaacs> i'm making a flamegraph
21:59 <@isaacs> ok, it's done.  you can go back to your irc'ing now.
21:59 <@isaacs> thanks for playing
21:59 < DTrejo> isaacs: http://imgur.com/yeZg9 :(
21:59 < flexd> isaacs: the menu is not highlighted when you go to the npm registry
21:59 < flexd> but it is for all the others
21:59 < flexd> well, all the others ive cicked so far
21:59 < flexd> clicked*
22:00 < DTrejo> i like how the colors change but the menu stays the same
22:00 < moxie> i thought npmjs.org was hacked and gibbed
22:01 < DTrejo> isaacs: also, when I tried to reset account, got this: http://imgur.com/jQrT3
22:02 < moxie> lol its written in javascript wtf
22:02 < moxie> makes no sense
22:02 < marshall> hey node
22:06 < context> woo npmjs.org was updated
22:06 < context> no wonder search.npmjs.org doesnt work anymore

22:11 < moxie> wtf who ruined the channel
22:11 < moxie> 9 ops?
22:12 <@isaacs> Domenic: it was cache key generation, actually
22:12 < moxie> losers

22:16 <@Nexxy> RIGHT NOW.
22:18 < skyler_brungardt> lol
22:19 < _lleo> anyone know a good mocha api ref
22:19 < _lleo> specifically how do you make and `it()` test skip if the previous one failed
22:20 < timoxley> _lleo you want to use the --bail option
22:20 < murvinlai> Can http.Client ( http.request) connect to more than one Host?  
22:20 < timoxley> on the commandline
22:20 < _lleo> gracias
22:20 < marshall> in express, do res.locals persist between requests? I've got some middleware that's supposed to provide a local only under certain conditions, but it appears that once that variable is added to `res.locals`, it's there for the duration of the process
22:22 < timoxley> marshall no
22:23 < timoxley> marshall perhaps you've got an issue with globals
22:24 < timoxley> marshall can you show us some code
22:24 < Domenic> RAAAAWR npm-www will bow to my will
22:25 < marshall> timoxley: what do you think could cause this confusion? I'm trying to get a logout view working. the login view attaches a user id to the req.session, then there is middleware on the app that checks for session.user._id, retrieves it if there is one, and does res.locals.user = user
22:25 < Domenic> But not today
22:25 < Domenic> `if (err) throw er` is the best stack trace
22:25 < marshall> the logout code simply deletes the req.session.user and does res.redirect('back')
22:26 < marshall> ok, I'll get a pastebin ready
22:27 < marshall> is that a sensible way of implementing login/logout functionality?
22:27 <@isaacs> DTrejo: what account were you trying to reset?
22:27 < timoxley> marshall i'd probably destroy the session
22:27 < Bux> ohai all
22:28 < timoxley> on logout
22:28 <@isaacs> marshall: yes-ish, but i'd do a few things differently.
22:29 <@isaacs> like timoxley said, destroy the whole session
22:29 <@isaacs> marshall: also, your "session" should be in redis
22:29 < jerrysv> isaacs: login/edit very slow - is it being hit heavily?

22:30 < Bux> ops plz
22:30 < timoxley> Domenic `assert.ifError(err)` is cleaner imo
22:30 < Bux> uhm
22:30 <@isaacs> Bux: we're taking a break from that
22:30 < timoxley> Bux fun over
22:30 < Bux> oh ok
22:30 < Bux> can I have it?
22:30 < Bux> :/
22:31 < Bux> what happened?
22:31 <@isaacs> Bux: people complained. too much modespam in the channel and silly stuff.  you can create a room to do crazy bot orgies in, if you really want to
22:31 < Bux> Oh I agree
22:31 < slickplaid> Does someone have a blog post or something I can give to a non-computer professional about floats/binary/c and why 149679.77777777778+320.2222222222226 = 150000 instead of 150000.0000000000026
22:31 < Bux> I just wanted a bot to let specific people op themselves, some sort of admin system
22:31 < Bux> didn't get round to that tho
22:31 < Bux> but fair enough
22:31 < slickplaid> the oddity of floats in computer language

22:32 < Bux> :P
22:33 < DTrejo> I don't see what know with ircecretary
22:33 < Bux> hmm?
22:33 < DTrejo> *don't see what's wrong with it
22:33 < Bux> its lengthy
22:34 <@isaacs> arg rabble rabble!
22:34 < Bux> and weird >_>
22:34 <@isaacs> DTrejo: it always works for me
22:34  * isaacs annoyed
22:34 < DTrejo> hmm, well let me try again
22:34 <@isaacs> DTrejo: you should have just gotten a reset email
22:34 < DTrejo> just checked and I did get one
22:34 < DTrejo> 1 minute ago
22:34 < Bux> oh ok, I'll call quits for the bots, if you need me again sometime, I'll stick around :P
22:36 < marshall> isaacs, timoxley: okay, thanks. I'd like to use couchdb for the session store (redis maybe, if the connect session store for couchdb is janky), but I'm just trying to get the basics working right now.
22:36 < timoxley> marshall post some code
22:36 < DTrejo> isaacs: I clicked the reset link but the page isn't loading
22:36 < Bux> I hate it when teamviewer blows up on me >_>
22:37 < DTrejo> isaacs: oh it just loaded. took ~30+ seconds
22:37 < cpsubrian> Using cluster .. how would I have a worker trigger the whole cluster to die?
22:37 < cpsubrian> send a message to master?
22:38 < DTrejo> great, just reset everything and it's all good now
22:38 <@isaacs> so, there's definitely some kind of issue still where template loads randomly take lots nad lots of seconds.
22:38 < DTrejo> seems like a lot of the links take a long time to load. Just clicked "edit profile" and it's taking a long time again. / isaacs
22:38 <@isaacs> yeah
22:38 <@isaacs> that ^
22:39 < DTrejo> shoulda used a framework ;)
22:39 <@isaacs> i ought to probably slap a timer on the request/response and log an error if it goes too long or something.
22:39 < jerrysv> isaacs: how do i change my photo on npmjs? it doesn't seem to just be pulling my gravatar?
22:39 <@isaacs> jerrysv: it is pulling the gravatar for the email address on your account
22:39 < awhamblin> slickplaid http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/02/05/dont-store-that-in-a-float/ is the best thing I've found on that. It's a bit technical, but makes all the reasons pretty clear with easy to follow examples 
22:39 < jerrysv> isaacs: odd. that's the same email address i use for every other gravatar :/
22:40 <@isaacs> jerrysv: what's your account?
22:41 < jerrysv> isaacs: jerrysievert - checking gravatar now
22:41 < jerrysv> isaacs: odd, my code@legitimatesounding.com gravatar seems to have gone mia
22:41 < jerrysv> isaacs: false alarm, sorry
22:42 <@isaacs> no worries :)
22:43 <@isaacs> DTrejo: trolololol
22:43 < Bux> alright, I'm going to bed, bye guys!
22:43 < DTrejo> isaacs: :)
22:48 < timoxley> why is util._extend?
22:49 <@isaacs> timoxley: that's internal
22:49 <@isaacs> don't use that
22:49 <@isaacs> timoxley: it just copies the properties of one arg onto the other
22:49 <@isaacs> for options and such
22:50 < timoxley> isaacs why internal?
22:50 <@isaacs> timoxley: because it's a bikeshed people can't stop whining about.
22:51 < timoxley> hahah
22:51 <@Nexxy> isaacs, is it wheelchair accessible?
22:51 <@isaacs> ie, it's stupidly sipmle, and if you want something fancier, write your own module or use one from npm or something
22:54 < timoxley> isaacs understood. I often find myself pulling a whole lib specifically for merging objects, which seems absurd
22:56 < timoxley> I blame javascript for having half-assed set of primitives
22:57 < marshall> timoxley: http://codr.cc/s/d540b78a/js
22:57 < timoxley> though it's not all lacklustre…  I'm sure glad we've got String#blink

23:02 < marshall> timoxley: updated the paste to include my express app configs http://codr.cc/s/d540b78a/js
23:03 < timoxley> marshall yep. looks fine. what about where you render the template
23:06 < marshall> timoxley: updated http://codr.cc/s/d540b78a/js
23:07 < timoxley> marshall where you actually call render()
