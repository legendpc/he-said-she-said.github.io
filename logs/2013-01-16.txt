00:00 < othiym23> Andy1991: duck typing? typeof? object.constructor.name?
00:00 < shesek> substack, it appears like people are installing browser addons on browserling
00:00 < TooTallNate> Andy1991: just check for the propertie(s) you need to use
00:01 < Andy1991> ty =]
00:04 < Andy1991> http://pastebin.com/SZM6ayDF
00:11 < othiym23> Andy1991: if you're creating a lot of Game objects, you're going to see less performance by creating those methods as closures
00:12 < segomos>  
00:12 < othiym23> Andy1991: and G.constructor.name is giving you exactly the right response there, because you're constructing an anonymous object
00:12 < Andy1991> Is there a better way?
00:13 < othiym23> Andy1991: TooTallNate's suggestion was more along the lines of "if (G && G.max_players) /* do whatever */"
00:13 < othiym23> yeah
00:13 < Andy1991> This project doesn't have a massive audience, but I'd like it to be optimised
00:13 < othiym23> actually put the methods on the prototype and don't worry about data-hiding until you need to
00:13 < Andy1991> How should I be doing it?
00:14 < othiym23> hold on a sec
00:14 < aroman> where do people like to store sensitive config information like DB access URIs and things?
00:14 < aroman> somehow I think having a file called "secrets.js" is a bad idea :P
00:14 < othiym23> aroman: in a file, on disk, with sensible access permissions ;)
00:15 < othiym23> if you can't trust your operating environment, you've got bigger problems
00:15 < aroman> yeah that's probably true
00:20 < othiym23> Andy1991: https://gist.github.com/6268678f4bdb50194e22
00:21 < othiym23> a simple, boring-assed, absolutely typical prototype-based class
00:22 < Andy1991> how would I implement private methods?
00:22 < TooTallNate> Andy1991: in the strict sense, you can't. but you can _prefix method names, and/or document that certain functions are private
00:22 < Andy1991> Ahh
00:23 < Andy1991> So, say I have 30 games in progress / hour
00:23 < Andy1991> will I see a massive difference?
00:23 < othiym23> you can also screw with Object.defineProperty(), but it makes for much more complex code
00:23 < TooTallNate> difference with what?
00:23 < othiym23> Andy1991: not a chance in hell, performance-wise
00:23 < TooTallNate> if you're worried about performance at this point it's probably premature
00:24 < Andy1991> cool
00:24 < PrgmrBill> how can I debug this? http://pastebin.com/imEz9mSU
00:24 < TooTallNate> just write code that works :)
00:24 < Andy1991> Thanks for the help =]
00:24 < TooTallNate> PrgmrBill: you're using an ancient version of npm, update it!
00:24 < othiym23> it's tough for the V8 JIT to optimize over closures, so you don't want to use that style of closure-based encapsulation on a hot path, but most of the time it doesn't matter
00:24 < tjfontaine> Andy1991: the best perf advice we can give you at this point of development, is use prototyped objects, and always initialized all fields in the same order
00:25 < Andy1991> tjfontaine: how come?
00:25 < tjfontaine> Andy1991: the jit can optimize things better for you if it sees the same "class" being used over and over for a method
00:25 < PrgmrBill> TooTallNate: I actually get the same error when I run npm update npm -g
00:26 < Andy1991> Ahh OK
00:26 < tjfontaine> Andy1991: v8 determines a class roughly by the order in which properties are added to an object
00:26 < TooTallNate> PrgmrBill: run this script https://npmjs.org/install.sh
00:26 < othiym23> PrgmrBill: you probably need to upgrade npm first, and not use npm to do it ;)
00:26 < Andy1991> So because I'm returning an object, I wont get that
00:26 < Andy1991> ?
00:26 < othiym23> Andy1991: the problem is not returning an object, it's the closures those methods create can't be optimized
00:27 < othiym23> because they're different for each instance of the object, as opposed to methods on a prototype
00:27 < Andy1991> Ahh
00:27 < PrgmrBill> TooTallNate: appears to have wroked. fabulous! thanks!
00:28 < TooTallNate> PrgmrBill: :)
00:30 < TonkaTruck> I'm working on my first realtime game app for iOS.  I've used web sockets with node before and it was quite painless.  Noticed RocketSocket lib for obj-c and was wondering what the downside of using web sockets outside of the browser was…needless overhead, etc.  Should I just use server.Socket?  I'm just sharing x-y coords with maybe 10 updates per second.
00:31 < othiym23> does anybody know a good way to generate EPERM for a socket connection on OS X?
00:31 < othiym23> like, a quick cli invocation to run against the built-in firewall?
00:32 < othiym23> (trying to repro a crash)
00:34 < superjoe> othiym23, maybe https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire
00:34 < spion> othiym23, I wonder if thats such a big performance hit... one closure context per instance shared among all methods, right?... one level of indirection... well yeah it can be, I guess.
00:35 < superjoe> othiym23, or you can open a socket server as root and then try to connect to it as non-root
00:35 < superjoe> but first chmod it
00:36 < othiym23> spion: http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/09/23/grokking-v8-closures-for-fun.html
00:36 < othiym23> don't take my word for it, Vyacheslav has forgotten more about optimizing V8 than I'll ever know
00:36 < othiym23> superjoe: those are both solid ideas, thanks
00:37 < superjoe> np
00:37 < spion> oh fun
00:46 < othiym23> should DNS resolution failures cause Node to crash?
00:47 < tjfontaine> can you be more specific?
00:48 < othiym23> sure, I have a customer with code that's crashing at startup with https://gist.github.com/4543628
00:48 < othiym23> looking at dns.js leads me to believe it's a call to dns.lookup that's failing
00:49 < othiym23> now, my guess is that they have their EC2 firewall locked down too tight, but it still seems weird that DNS lookup could crash the whole process
00:49 < othiym23> tjfontaine: ^^
00:49 < tjfontaine> eacces is odd
00:50 <@konobi> sounds like selinux or one of those things
00:50 < tjfontaine> othiym23: I'm guessing that errno is set from c-ares, not being able to bind for an outbound dns socket, or possible reading /etc/hosts
00:51 < othiym23> tjfontaine: check the comment I just added to the gist
00:51 < tjfontaine> though file would be eperm I guess
00:51 < othiym23> konobi: yeah, I'm guessing it's a firewall rule set by the EC2 hypervisor
00:51 < TonkaTruck> Is there something higher level than net.Server that I can use for a multiplayer iOS game?  Still wondering if I should just use web sockets as there's already open source RocketSocket.
00:52 < othiym23> tjfontaine: if you look further up the stacktrace, it's somewhere inthe guts of Server.listen when it crashes when it barfs
00:52 < othiym23> s/when it barfs//
00:53 <@konobi> othiym23: does a plain "dig" work?
00:53 < othiym23> konobi: not a machine I have hands-on access to, unforch
00:53 < othiym23> and there appears to be some ESL or ETL in the mix
00:53 <@konobi> ?
00:53 < othiym23> English as a Third Language
00:54 <@konobi> oh, the client
00:54 < tjfontaine> I agree more with konobi on this, selinux/apparmour seem more likely at fault, not the resolution the fact that it's in listen is a by product of just trying to bind the socket in general
00:56 < othiym23> I should be able to catch that failure from http.request
00:56 < othiym23> like, having a straightforward http.request with an error handler definied crash the process seems like a bug
01:00 < cTIDE> that's asking a lot othiym23 friend
01:01 < othiym23> cTIDE: I'm a demanding person
01:01 < niggler> othiym23 so is your mother
01:02 -!- niggler was kicked from #Node.js by Nexxy [niggler]
01:02 < othiym23> niggler: it's very true, although I'd really describe her more as somewhat self-involved
01:02 < othiym23> aw
01:02 <@Nexxy> othiym23, just bind an error handler before listening
01:03 <@Nexxy> then you will catch the EACCESS
01:03 < othiym23> Nexxy: *I'm* not listening, http.request is
01:03 < othiym23> it's using dns.lookup to find the IP address for the hostname
01:04 < othiym23> and the EPERM isn't getting grabbed and shoved onto http.requests error emitter
01:04 < othiym23> I'd use a domain here, but this chunk of the code needs to run under 0.6
01:05 < starter_> quick question:
01:05 < starter_> got a mongoose model, with an array in it
01:06 < starter_> I do: var myObj = new myObj();
01:06 < starter_> myObj.participants = [];
01:06 < starter_> and then myObj.participants.push(someObjIcreatedBefore)
01:07 < scott_gonzalez> isaacs: Is license not a standard field for package.json?
01:07 < starter_> i then get Cannot call method 'call' of undefined 
01:07 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: it's not a field npm does anything with
01:07 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: but it's pretty commonly used.
01:07 <@isaacs> "license":"BSD" etc
01:07 <@isaacs> you still ought to have a LICENSE file in your project root
01:07 < scott_gonzalez> isaacs: Yeah, I'm not seeing any docs for it.
01:07 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: that's because nothing special is done with it
01:08 < scott_gonzalez> I'm asking because we documented it, and I feel like we didn't come up with the format.
01:08 < scott_gonzalez> we = jQuery, for the plugins site.
01:08 < niggler> isaacs who is responsible for license violations?
01:08 <@isaacs> niggler: the violator
01:08 <@isaacs> niggler: if you report it, they'll be removed from npm.
01:08 <@isaacs> but that's super rare, especially since you have to kind of go out of your way to violate MIT or BSD, which most node programs are.
01:09 < othiym23> tjfontaine, konobi: customer got back to me, and it was their security configuration. Good call!
01:09 < scott_gonzalez> isaacs: Oh, we must've taken this from commonjs.
01:09 < scott_gonzalez> So I guess there are people using `license` and people using `licenses`.
01:10 < tjfontaine> othiym23: good to know
01:10 < niggler> and then there's GPL's "COPYING" scott_gonzalez
01:11 < scott_gonzalez> niggler: I'm only concerned about parsing the json.
01:12 < othiym23> OK, so if I want to deal with this in my code, I need to do the DNS resolution myself before calling http.request
01:12 < othiym23> a pain in the ass, but reasonable
01:12 < othiym23> so Nexxy was right after all
01:13 < aandy> before*
01:18 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: yeah
01:18 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: silly, of course.  no one uses multiple licenses for stuff in teh npm registry
01:18 < superjoe> I've been seeing more usage of the wtfpl recently
01:19 < superjoe> I approve
01:19 <@isaacs> you're licensing the version in the registry in some specific way, always
01:19 <@isaacs> superjoe: i'd like to see a "free as in hugs" license.
01:19 < superjoe> ha! me too
01:20 < superjoe> I just use what npm defaults to - BSD
01:20 < superjoe> if npm started defaulting to something else I'd probably still go with it
01:20 < superjoe> <3 defaults
01:20 <@isaacs> yeah
01:20 <@isaacs> i like bsd because it's short and EAST BAY REPRESENT!
01:20 < scott_gonzalez> Just wait till isaacs moves to the East Coast and it'll be MIT :-P
01:20 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: i used to use MIT because i'm from new england
01:21 < scott_gonzalez> I know :-)
01:21 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: but then i moved to oakland, and started going to berkeley city college (which is a far cry from UCB, but still)
01:22 < scott_gonzalez> I often wonder why ISC isn't popular.
01:22 <@isaacs> they're effectively the same license
01:22 <@isaacs> scott_gonzalez: no idea.  what's ISC?
01:23 < scott_gonzalez> BSD with less language.
01:23 < scott_gonzalez> It removes the language that's already in place due to the Berne convention.
01:23 < scott_gonzalez> But I suppose in some countries you'd still want that language.
01:26 <@isaacs> i like the ISC license because it looks like my name.
01:26 < scott_gonzalez> haha
01:30 < superjoe> my favorite is still tumbolia public license
01:30 < superjoe> it's like a big "fuck you" to lawyers
01:30 < niggler> wtfpl
01:31 < niggler> and in fact actually has a wiki page
01:31 <@isaacs> superjoe: that's the "opan sauce lol" license, right?
01:31 <@Nexxy> othiym23, O rly
01:32 < superjoe> isaacs, yes
01:32 < superjoe> 0. opan saurce LOL
01:32 < richweskus> >:)
01:32 < richweskus> tomato?
01:34 < superjoe> this is utterly brilliant
01:34 < superjoe> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkRVzciAZg
01:35 < othiym23> Nexxy: yeah, I changed my code to lookup the hostname http.request is connecting to, and to handle lookup failure there
01:35 < othiym23> although I need to do some more work to make sure I don't break virtual host requests
01:45 < heath> trying to save the post request to the fs
01:45 < heath> hoping someone might take a look at this gist
01:45 < heath>  var http = require('http');                                                                                                                                              
01:45 < heath>  var fs = require('fs');

01:46 < heath> sorry
01:46 < heath> https://gist.github.com/96a7f806dc06a2a7f28d
01:46 < heath> that
01:46 <@Nexxy> rofl
01:46 < heath> yeah
01:46 < heath> sorry about that
01:46 <@Nexxy> heath, oh man
01:47 <@Nexxy> you better be!
01:47 < heath> i am!
01:47  * heath cries in shame for Nexxy
01:47 <@Nexxy> maybe
01:47 <@Nexxy> if we all accidentally paste some code
01:47 <@Nexxy> heath won't feel so bad
01:51 < TooTallNate> heath: forget res.on('data'), instead do res.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('filename'))
01:52 < othiym23> TooTallNate: how conversant are you with the DNS module / c-ares?
01:53 < TooTallNate> othiym23: i've used it once or twice..
01:53 < othiym23> I'm wondering if I pass in a pre-looked-up IP address in a string, will it still perform a lookup, or just translate it into an IP address?
01:54 < tjfontaine> othiym23: .lookup does a net.isIP check
01:54 < tjfontaine> iirc
01:54 < othiym23> thanks tjfontaine 
01:54 < tjfontaine> I'm verifying, if not, that's what you should do :)
01:55 < othiym23> I'm not sure if the hosts I'm talking to require a Host: header sent, but I also need to do the resolution myself so I can not crash the app if resolution fails for whatever reason, and it would be nice to not perform any more lookups than I need to
01:55 < othiym23> that's a lotta requirements in one place there
01:55 < tjfontaine> ya, master does a net.isIP check
01:56 < tjfontaine> https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/dns.js#L109
01:56 < othiym23> thanks tjfontaine 
01:57 < othiym23> back to figuring out how to abuse http.request to do what I want
01:57 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
02:11 < robertj> anyone wann cast a vote in favor of a light-weight ACL solution?
02:12 < robertj> virgen-acl and simple-acl both look nice
02:15 < wavded> hey node crew, requiring a json file from multiple files and manipulating that json in one of the files, manipulates it everywhere, is that intended?
02:16 < tjfontaine> wavded: you'll need to supply more context for that question
02:17 < wavded> say you have a program that is made up of 3 or more files, and each of them requires a common 'json' file (using require('')).. if one of files changes that json file, all of the files get the change
02:17 < aroman> othiym23: so i'm really liking this 'dal' pattern. one question though, how do you handle the scenario where the dal is being require()'d, yet has already been previously require()'d elsewhere in the app? You'd basically be telling the database to open a connection which is already open, which will error. How do you address this use case? 
02:18 < aroman> (Currently I'm just having models.connect() do a no-op if it sees mongoose already has a connection, but that feels kind of crude)
02:18 < styol>  wavded
02:18 < wavded> i would expect each of the files to get a unique copy of the json file
02:18 < othiym23> aroman: that's why the DAL is an object itself -- you just create a new instance of the DAL wherever you're using it, passing it the collection / db / connection at instantiation time
02:18 < tjfontaine> wavded: you mean if you require('file').foobar all modules see foobar?
02:18 < wavded> although I know this is not the case for js files being required
02:19 < othiym23> aroman: I tend to avoid ever having the connection state being held in the module where the DAL is defined for exactly that reason, and because it's really easy to create race conditions that way
02:20 < arinel> wavded: read "Caching" here http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html
02:20 < aroman> othiym23: how does the context creating the new DAL object have knowledge of or access the db connection object?
02:20 < wavded> arinel: yep i read that, i just don't see why you'd want to have a cached version of a json file across all your modules
02:21 < wavded> i can see it for a js.. seems like the only way to get a unique copy is to fs.readFileSync instead of require
02:21 < arinel> wavded: I don't see why you'd load the same file more than once
02:21 < aroman> for example, in my test suite, I test dal.js and some_module_which_requires_dal.js
02:23 < aroman> should I create the connection object in test.js and pass it to both the dal.js i'm calling from test.js AND to some_other_module_which_requires_dal.js (to have it be in turn bubbled back up to some_other_module_which_requires_dal.js's instantiation of the DAL)?
02:24 < wavded> arinel: if moda.js needs json file but has to sort it for example and modb.js needs the same json file but has to splice it, they can't both require it and do that or they will clobber each other
02:24 < othiym23> aroman: my concept is that there are many instances of the DAL class each using a collection -- either one shared connection, or one per DAL instance
02:25 < othiym23> aroman: the module using the DAL needs to have the collection injected somehow, either via initialization or by being object-based itself, and that's where it gets the collection / connection it's using
02:25 < arinel> wavded: you could probably make a copy of that object
02:26 < aroman> othiym23: i see. so if I basically need to "bubble up
02:26 < othiym23> aroman: it's probably a super anal way to do things, but it ensures that you never have a situation where you're just passing around connection state via a global
02:27 < wavded> right, that what i have to do, or Object.freeze it so I know none of the modules that require it are messing with it, but i'm trying to think why you wouldn't do that in the first place, you know the rationale?
02:27 < othiym23> aroman: another thing you can do is use a connection pool to create a service-layer API that delegates to the individual DALs, but then you're getting into Java levels of abstraction and the world becomes a cold and grim place
02:28 < arinel> wavded: I have no idea. I'm kind of working against this caching business myself
02:28 < aroman> othiym23: right. I guess my question is really who creates the original connection object?
02:28 < aroman> i could obviously get around all this by just opening new connections every time I require a different module that uses the DAL
02:28 < othiym23> aroman: wherever you're plugging all this stuff together, i.e. the main app
02:28 < othiym23> so for testing, the test setup would take care of plugging everything together
02:29 < aroman> ah now I follow.
02:29 < aroman> so in test.'s, I create the connection object. I then pass that connection object to the various modules I need to test that use the DAL
02:30 < othiym23> yeah, using whatever factory methods or whatever make sense to you
02:30 < jtomasrl> what would be the best way of managing roles using nosql?
02:32 < arinel> question: how do I organize a module if I need to create a new state every time the main function in that module is called? 
02:32 < arinel> are there any docs on this?
02:33 < arinel> if I use "vars", or "this", they remember their state
02:34 < othiym23> arinel: create a new object and return that
02:36 < arinel> othiym23: i.e. exports.main=new Main(); ?
02:37 < othiym23> arinel: no, as in module.exports = function () { return new Main(); };
02:38 < aroman> othiym23: right. so working off of your original code sample, and using function-based modules, I might have something like this? http://pastie.org/5691545
02:39 < othiym23> aroman: yeah, something like that
02:39 < arinel> othiym23: thanks!
02:39 < aroman> alright. i'll have to play around with it some, but i think i've got the gist of what you're angling at. thanks again :)
02:41 < othiym23> aroman: you're welcome, and let me know how it works out for you
02:41 < othiym23> this is a pattern that works well for me, but I have no idea how typical it is
02:42 < othiym23> I haven't seen a lot of other people's database code
02:43 < aroman> yeah neither have I.
02:44 < aroman> frankly it's one of the areas I feel the least comfortable with in node. not many conventions I can see (which is of course great for flexibility, but kind of frustrating when you're interested in looking for the common/best practice)
02:49 < eydaimon> Anyone know how to get pretty-printing in expressjs using jade? I can't figure out how to set options for the templating language
02:49 < aroman> eydaimon: app.locals.pretty = true
02:50 < aroman> (in express 3)
02:50 < eydaimon> aroman: thanks much
02:51 < eydaimon> aroman: how did you know this? I searched the documentation again now that I knew what to look for ...
02:52 < aroman> eydaimon: I probably google'd around.
02:52 < aroman> pretty regular old google search will turn up stuff like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5276892/expressjs-how-to-output-pretty-html
02:53 < aroman> the issue is that documenting that doesn't really fall under the responsibilities of either express or jade directly
02:54 < eydaimon> aroman: yeah, I read both but didn't see in either. I'd put it under express since that's what buries the options though.
02:54 < aroman> since it's really a question of setting a template rendering option in express (the template engine happens to be jade). so you'd have to look up how to generically pass template rendering options through express (express docs) and then what variable you actually need (jade docs, presumably)
03:05 < styol> What is a decent approach for conditionally calling functions with callbacks? For instance, a series of 3 functions that are normally strewn together awaiting the response from the previous function that needs to be converted into each function being optional
03:06 < styol> I'm guessing something control flow related like the async module, but which method, me not sure... async.queue?
03:10 < tgriesser> styol: i've been liking q.js for deferred/promises
03:13 < othiym23> styol: that sounds like a perfect use case for EventEmitters
03:14 < styol> tgriesser: interesting.. i don't see how i can conditionally `then` something though without having a switch case or something with some duplicateyness
03:15 < styol> othiym23: hrm perhaps you is right. EventEmitters are a decent replacement for spaghetti and meatballs, myes?
03:16 < othiym23> seems like a pretty good way to get conditional control flow, at least
03:16 < othiym23> I pretty much wrote an entire component around that pattern
03:18 < styol> I recall reading something about replacing the common flow with EventEmitters
03:20 < styol> othiym23: do you have a simple example by chance of replacing a chain of awesomeness with EventEmitters?
03:21 < styol> hrm might be a decent replacement for the constant use of `if (err) return callback(true, 'roger we have uh oh');`
03:22 < othiym23> styol: https://gist.github.com/937d6e6297cac08175e2 -- look at the onWhatever functions towards the bottom of the file
03:23 < othiym23> also check out createDataSender, which is where a lot of the magic happens
03:24 < cainus> Hey all... anyone have a version manager suggestion aside from nvm and n?
03:24 < othiym23> cainus: if you don't mind using subshells to run your code, nave is pretty nice
03:24 < othiym23> uses the official binaries, etc
03:24 < cainus> what do you mean by 'subshells'?
03:24 < othiym23> also was written by isaacs, so it has that going for it
03:25 < cainus> something like rvm uses?
03:25 < styol> othiym23: berry interesting, especially the use within prototype and this.emit
03:25 < othiym23> cainus: it spawns a new bash process and sets up the PATH and other other environment variables just in that shell to use whichever version you specify
03:25 < othiym23> it's more like rbenv than rvm, tho
03:26 < cainus> hmmm okay... I'll take a look at it
03:26 < cainus> n was about as simple as it gets... would be nice to get that kind of simplicity
03:27 < othiym23> I think nave's approach is actually simpler
03:27 < othiym23> it has very few bells and whistles aside from how it will opportunistically download a binary install if one is available
03:30 < cainus> heh yeah it's simple as hell so far.  nice
03:32 < styol> othiym23: You prefer the prototype method of defining functions / classes / whatever its called? I had recently heard that the prototype approach is more performant
03:33 < styol> but also recently did some simple benchmarks today with benchmark.js (used to power jsperf) and was a bit surprised to find that it is quite a bit slower, unless I'm doing something wrong which is what i usually assume… guilty until proven innocent haha
03:34 < othiym23> styol: I always use prototypes if I can, because when the V8 JIT kicks in, it can optimize shared methods much better than singleton methods defined over closures
03:34 < othiym23> all of the objects in that gist are stateful
03:35 < cainus> I'd guess prototypes would use less memory as well
03:36 < styol> yeah I'm a bit confused by the results also.. familiar with benchmark.js by chance and/or maybe just interested in checking out a test case to see if i'm making a deadly mistake that is swaying the results?
03:36 < recamilio> Hi guys... I'm having a hell of pain with HTTPS proxying... I'm not sure if it's a node "issue", if I can call like that, but, I can't get a HTTPS proxy working, and there's some logic code to check if the client might access internet (as a mobile phone service provider).... Someone out there could give me alight, plz?!
03:38 < othiym23> styol: my list of shit to do will keep me busy well into 2017 ;p
03:41 < styol> othiym23: wordie.. perhaps a simple boil down -- see anything wrong with this? Function foo(){} Foo.prototype.bar = function() { return true; } var foo = new Foo(); foo.bar();
03:42 < othiym23> styol: nothing wrong with that beyond capitalization errors, but it's probably too simple for the JIT to do much with
03:43 < styol> ah yeah, whoops.. thats what i get for typing it out
03:43 < styol> I'm just confused because, at least with a basic definition, it is 4-7 times slower then other approaches in node.. but yeah you're probably right, needs something meatier probably
03:46 < recamilio> folks.. I need to implement  a "hacknroll" man in the middle solution to bypass the ssl proxy.. any thoughtful ideas?

04:12 < recamilio> tjfontaine: I even didn't know about CONNECT, just googled about it...

06:52 < MiniGod> hey guys. im trying to use child_process.spawn, but the `data` event doesnt fire until the process exits. im using node v0.6.18
06:53 < MiniGod> is that a bug, or just a weird edge case?
06:54 < andu> Bit of a strange question.. Anyone know what is the most efficient way to increase node's memory by using an SSD? Is the best way to just use unix swap partition?
06:56 < L10n> MiniGod: what are you spawning?
06:57 < andu> And, can this then effectively increase the size we can operate on in memory to something close to 640GB :D or even raid those puppies
06:57 < MiniGod> a game server
06:58 < MiniGod> its just basic console - no input either
06:58 < andu> MiniGod, i think it has to have stdout stream?
06:59 < MiniGod> the data event on stdout fires... just... not untill the process stops
06:59 < MiniGod> ie. right before exit fires
06:59 < L10n> can you pastebin the code and output that is showing that?
07:00 < MiniGod> L10n: http://pastebin.com/Vkm7WJN5
07:05 < MiniGod> L10n, does it make sense? its part of something bigger, but i hope that was all you need.
07:09 < L10n> ya, the code is pretty clear. im kind of wondering how this process your spawning works.
07:09 < L10n> ill assume its expected to do something and output data to stdout for a while before exiting?
07:09 < L10n> anyway you can show the output that is suspect?
07:12 < MiniGod> launching it normally in terminal works fine. and stdout gets all the data (right before the exit event, as mentioned earlier). right now i have config error on the server (on purpose) so that it will exit faster, because otherwise it runs forever (or until i ^C it)
07:14 < ashnur> anyone used queryengine before?
07:15 < ashnur> i woud like to know if it's possible to query models by array of objects and not just strings
07:17 < L10n> MiniGod: is that by design tho on the process you're spawning. for most utilities it's common to output and exit. which sounds like what you're doing.
07:18 < MiniGod> L10n: launching it in terminal though, it works just fine... each line is streaming
07:18 < L10n> you're not trying to push this data to the browser are you?
07:18 < MiniGod> no
07:19 < MiniGod> not yet, atleast
07:23 < MiniGod> L10n: do you have any clue? cause im totally lost on this
07:23 < L10n> could be something witht he chunk size of the stream.
07:26 < MiniGod> L10n: its about 700 characters before it exists... :\
07:28 < dch> moin.
07:28 < dch> Is there any info on reliability of streams, and orderedness? I've not found any googleable stuff yet.
07:29 < dch> (1) can I make any guarantees about whether a stream can lose items? e.g. assuming range 1….10 is sent, if I receive 10 does that mean 1… 9 must have come through?
07:30 < dch> (2) is it possible for 1… 10 to arrive in a different order than sent?
07:36 < L10n> MiniGod: yeah, def. the chunk size sent from yoru process to node. i believe that is handled by the operating system.
07:38 < MiniGod> L10n: wha? what do you mean? too small? too big?
07:42 < Carlito> Hi everybody
07:44 < Carlito> I've been googling for a while now and I can't find any working example of Javascript PDF generation (which works both in IE and other browsers). Do you guys know if Node.js can be a candidate for this? Thanks in advance for your time.
07:49 < tPl0ch> hmm, is it possible to pass the bin dir to the configure script? I want to install to /opt/node, but the binary should be symlinked in /usr/bin
07:49 < L10n> MiniGod: same issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11425237/why-cant-node-js-emit-data-event-on-child-process-stdout
07:49 < andu> Carlito, have you looked at pdfkit? whats wrong with it?
07:50 < andu> http://pdfkit.org/
07:50 < L10n> so it's not node, it's the program being called.
07:51 < Carlito> andu : I've had a look at it but it seems that node.js is not a regular javascript file as it is executed on server-side
07:52 < andu> You want pdf generation client side?
07:53 < andu> pdfkit is coffeescript.. but that still compiles to javascript compatible scripts so thats no problem
07:53 < Carlito> I'm working on a corporate web application and we don't have access to either the file system nor webserver. We can only host .html files and include js to perform the action
07:53 < MiniGod> L10n: tyvm. good find (i couldnt find anything) - i guess i have to talk to the devs of that game now -.-
07:53 < andu> Carlito, so you arent dealing with nodejs at all then
07:53 < SomeoneWeird> Carlito, so convert the coffee to js, then use browserify
07:54 < andu> yeah what SomeoneWeird said
07:54 < Carlito> Yes I want to render the page that the user is viewing in PDF and allow him to download it (except that I can't generate the pdf on server-side and make a link to it)
07:54 < L10n> MiniGod: Good luck!
07:54 < SomeoneWeird> not sure you'll be able todo that
07:54 < andu> oh wow.. Carlito seriously, just let people use print to pdf then
07:55 < andu> html translate to pdfkit automatically is going to be huge undertaking
07:56 < Carlito> andu SomeoneWeird : They use IE 7-9 / Firefox so I guess I'm also fuc*** up with this solution ^^
07:56 < Carlito> andu : Exactly what I was guessing...
07:56 < andu> Carlito, just install pdfprinter.. they click print and select the fakesoftware pdf printer
07:57 < Carlito> andu : Thanks you just confirmed my assumptions
07:57 < ashnur> anyone here used query-engine before?
07:57 < andu> :) sorry, but yeah
07:58 < GreenDog> what? there's no pdf generator npm?
07:58 < Carlito> Thank you guys. I'll try to convince my clients then ^^
07:59 < GreenDog> i'll make one and get uber rich!
08:01 < andu> GreenDog, there is. npm install pdfkit
08:01 < GreenDog> darn
08:01 < GreenDog> there goes my fortune
08:02 < mscdex> i think there is a binding to poppler too
08:03 < Carlito> GreenDog : but if you build a js client-side framework to generate easy-styled PDF and Word documents on the fly, your fortune is assured
08:04 < GreenDog> woot!
08:04 < Carlito> jsPDF does that apparently but it doesn't work on IE6+ (they use a flash shim instead which is not available to download on they website)
08:04 < mscdex> heh
08:04 < GreenDog> i'll get right on that
08:04 < Carlito> ^^
08:05 < Carlito> This is useful to address issues implied by the use of software like Oracle CRM On Demand
08:05 < Carlito> and the potential market for this... is thus very large
08:05 < Carlito> amongst companies
08:06 < Carlito> but whatever, I'll stick to PDF fakeprinting for the time being
08:06 < andu> Carlito, isnt the market even more ripe for a oracle crm replacement with full nodejs stack?
08:06 < andu> thats essentially what we're doing
08:07 < Carlito> I think there is a potential market but unfortunately even with better solutions, you'll get crushed commercially by Oracle teams (frankly speaking they'll sell their souls to make a deal)
08:07 < andu> well we're going full opensource
08:08 < andu> and just using the stack for specific clients we've already got
08:08 < andu> they paying for us to help build opensource further
08:08 < Carlito> and (even if they're often wrong), clients rely on big brands and trust big companies regarding CRM
08:08 < Carlito> and you live off with developments/customization/consulting?
08:08 < andu> yeah, thats true.. our market are individuals and startups with small budgets
08:09 < andu> well we started as a creative studio doing 3d animation and art etc
08:09 < andu> then got into web
08:09 < Carlito> true fact, but that's how companies like SugarCRM for example started the thing
08:09 < Carlito> then they got bigger (but still opensource application)
08:10 < Carlito> (sorry for my poor sentences in advance I'm french)
08:10 < andu> we're just looking to have bigdata style automation and stats for our clients on the cheap
08:11 < Carlito> I got it. Where are you guys based?
08:11 < andu> also.. i'm doing arduino integration for custom solutions that feeds into the nodejs stack
08:11 < andu> johannesburg south africa
08:11 < andu> but the electronics stuff is very new 
08:11 < andu> rest has been going 3 years now, team of 5 full time
08:12 < Carlito> great stuff, there are many business opportunities around this I believe
08:12 < Carlito> starting with DIY elec solutions
08:12 < andu> yeah me too, mayor innovation opportunities
08:12 < Carlito> that can be used to break into the market
08:13 < andu> and cheap to get into
08:13 < Carlito> yes but remember to deliver value, the largest profitable business don't come from innovation ^^
08:13 < andu> http://8bo.org/  is the main company
08:14 < andu> http://fluentart.com/  is my consulting/blog/opensource thing
08:14 < andu> yeah, turn key stuff :)
08:15 < Carlito> I've been working with the inventor of Nabaztag rabbit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabaztag and this is no technical innovation, only marketing innovation
08:16 < andu> haha yeah, thats it
08:16 < andu> just more business orientated
08:16 < andu> realtime info on web activity/queries etc
08:16 < Carlito> = profit $$
08:17 < andu> yup
08:17 < andu> its nothing new.. its just scaling up from the phone voice system to automated data communication
08:17 < andu> properly. 
08:17 < andu> thats the hard part
08:18 < andu> the other side of this... this is absolutely going to kill unskilled labour
08:18 < andu> already is
08:19 < Carlito> and has been for the past 100 years, only the pace differs ^^
08:19 < andu> true
08:20 < Carlito> see you guys then, good luck and enjoy what you're doing !
08:36 < [AD]Turbo> hi there
08:38 < jvanveen> hey
08:40 < TonkaTruck> https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore is this still good for private node projects?  I just have to manage my dependencies with package.json with node_modules in .gitignore I guess.

09:47 < Bergle_1> industrial - no - get  nodes-fs   or maybe mkdirp modules - note: ive had hiccup with one odd boundary case on mkdirp on windows so id suggest node-fs :) 
09:47 < Industrial> ok
09:50 < vikash> hi Everyone, I have a Node.js Application. Now I want to run it in a Windows Azure VM 2008 R2 so that anyone can access it. but I am unable to find some good resource. Can anyone please help me with this :) or suggest me some pointers
09:50 < vikash> Thanks in advance :)
09:52 < dch> vikash: it might help if you indicate what you have tried and failed with, otherwise I'd suggest the first two links on http://lmgtfy.com/?q=running+node+azure
09:53 < vikash> dch, well I did try those.. and some problems. never mind I will try again.. and don't worry I will direct google it.. instead of lmgtfy :P
09:55 < dch> vikash: so what problems did you run into? firewall issues are common for example.
09:55 < dch> vikash: the lmgtfy is a gentle hint that if you can be more explicit with your problem "it doesn't work" people can be more useful with their assistance.
09:56 < vikash> No worries :). While installing Website Panel2.0.0 it get errors!
10:00 < dch> vikash: is this some asp component or other framework? I've pushed basic node apps to azure, and have not run into this.
10:01 < vikash> dch its a simple node.js chat application
10:01 < dch> can you get a basic node app running? 
10:02 < vikash> dch yup its running locally and I got it running on the server (on localhost) too. Did you use only azure-cli?
10:04 < dch> vikash: do you get any error message at all?
10:05 < vikash> dch.. I will try once again and in case , I fail again. I will get back :)
10:06 < dch> vikash: I use https://github.com/tjanczuk/git-azure a while back though, here's a tutorial on it http://nodeblog.azurewebsites.net/develop-on-mac-host-on-github-and-deploy-to-windows-azure
10:06 < vikash> I have to deploy it on the VM. so will these link help?
10:08 < dch> vikash: hard to say for sure, its a worker role so if that matches your architecture then yes. 
10:08 < vikash> ok.
10:08 < tPl0ch> Can I get a +1 for adding a './configure' option '--bin-dir', so node can be installed with prefix '/opt/node' and still be symlinked to i.e. '/usr/local/bin'
10:12 < emilsedgh> i published a package a few days ago, but i named it 'pdu.js'. then i read that i should omid '.js', so i published a new package named 'pdu'. how can i remove the old pdu.js?
10:13 < emilsedgh> i tried unpublish, but it only removed the last version.
10:14 < phun-ky> npm unpublish pdu@<version>
10:14 < phun-ky> or npm unpublish pdu.js@<version>

10:22 < emilsedgh> thanks phun-ky. any way of removing whole package?
10:36 < Exx2xxO> Hello! I got a little problem: I want to realise a "Select folder" Dialog box with node and jquery. Any idea how to do it?
10:37 < SomeoneWeird> what's the best way to generate/write js (in general) docs?
10:39 < milani> SomeoneWeird, I think writing them manually using markdown is the best solution
10:39 < mscdex> SomeoneWeird: by hand!
10:39 < mscdex> :-D
10:40 < milani> but if you want something more technical, https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck
10:40 < SomeoneWeird> mscdex, that outa be fun
10:40 < mscdex> it is
10:40 < SomeoneWeird> cheers, will look milani 
10:40 < mscdex> i do it for all of my modules
10:41 < SomeoneWeird> mscdex, yeah i've done it for all my previous ones, but hopefully this project gets quite bigger so I want something easy
10:41 < mscdex> heh
10:41 < mscdex> start documenting early and it won't be so bad :-)
10:41 < SomeoneWeird> shoosh
10:41 < SomeoneWeird> "Simple JavaScript Duckumentation generator"
10:41 < SomeoneWeird> i lol'd
10:43 < Gottox> I'm writing my docs by hand too.
10:43 < Gottox> But I don't think, that's a permanent solution.
10:44 < rump> check out tj's dox and markdox
10:44 < rump> neat solution
10:44 < Gottox> rump: looking into it, thanks :)

10:52 < Havvy> What's the module(s) to use if you want a generic SQL driver?
10:55 < strk> I can I write a tiny (oneliner?) stream that is always at EOF and discards any incoming data ?
11:07 < emilsedgh> i guess i kindof messed with npmjs: https://npmjs.org/package/pdu.js
11:16 < Exx2xxO> Is there any way how to create a "select folder"-dialog ?
11:18 < klaemo> Havvy: https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql
11:18 < Havvy> That is just for mysql, no?
11:19 < klaemo> yeah, sorry didn't read your question correctly ;)
11:19 < freewil> the only one i know of is any-db

11:21 < abarre> hi all
11:21 < abarre> I try to add a debug line in the http.js file
11:21 < Havvy> A'ight.
11:21 < abarre> but I can not see the modification when I test
11:22 < abarre> should I only do : ./configure and make??
11:22 < abarre> to see my modification
11:25 < dileep> dileep@dileep-VirtualBox:/$ mongo MongoDB shell version: 2.2.2 connecting to: test Wed Jan 16 16:11:35 Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017 src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:91 exception: connect failed                        the erroe comes to me plz have solution
11:26 < Havvy> dileep: It failed to connect to the MongoDB.
11:26 < dileep> havvy,yyeah how could i overthat
11:27 < Havvy> Well, is your MongoDB running?
11:27 < dileep> i uninsttall it and again install again the same error
11:27 < dileep> no
11:27 < mansoor-s> any c++ devs here? Know of a library that works in the same way Async in the node world works?
11:28 < mansoor-s> (in an evented environment)
11:28 < Havvy> dileep: MongoDB is itself a program, and needs to be running for anything to connect to it.
11:29 < Gottox> mansoor-s: maybe libuv?
11:29 < dileep> yeah i know but aftr installation when i enter mongo the following error comes
11:30 < Havvy> Can you connect to the MongoDB manually?
11:30 < mansoor-s> Gottox, i'm not looking for an eventloop lib
11:30 < mansoor-s> i'm looking for a way to manage asyn io operations
11:30 < dileep> hm
11:30 < mansoor-s> async*
11:30 < mansoor-s> the way https://github.com/caolan/async does for node
11:37 < joeytwiddle> npmjs.org was down for at least 3 minutes.  i panicked
11:37 < SomeoneWeird> o no
11:40 < bid> hi, is there a copy folder with exclude? 
11:40 < bid> wrench
11:54 < flexd> Hm, that's odd.. I'm playing with blitz.io (generating traffic) towards a simple node.js application (basically just "static" templates), behind a varnish instance.
11:55 < flexd> Stuff is being cached, but I get timeout errors from blitz.. wtf :/
11:55 < flexd> It should basically be fetching stuff from memory, it should be able to take like 1000 req/s :/
12:01 < flexd> mansoor-s: What do you mean by "manage async operations?:
12:01 < flexd> "
12:07 < TheDeveloper___> anyone know of good modules for managing cluster core?
12:37 < nurettin> mansoor-s: are you asking for a signals library? (boost.signals2 ? sigc++ ?)
12:38 < mansoor-s> flexd, nurettin sorry i was afk, I'm over thinking the problem. Essencially what I want to do is fire off a bunch of  IO operations, and say notify me when they are all done
12:38 < mansoor-s> this is in a Qt event loop environment
12:39 < jvanveen> heyh
12:39 < jvanveen> anyone know of some examples of sending binary data with ws?
12:40 < nurettin> qt QIODevice has a signal for end of read
12:41 < nurettin> which has nothing to do with this channel
12:41 < jvanveen> i wonder if with binaryjs, i can send json the same way as with vanilla ws
12:47 < Exx2xxO> How do I correctly respond to an ajax post request?
12:48 < milani> mansoor-s, use libuv's worker threads.
12:48 < milani> do your job in another thread, call callback in main thread after finishing the job.
12:52 < milani> mansoor-s, https://github.com/appjs/appjs/blob/master/src/native_window/native_window.cpp#L80
12:54 < milani> mansoor-s, https://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/master/test/test-threadpool.c
12:55 < mansoor-s> milani, I get that, I was hoping there was a flow control library
12:55 < mansoor-s> i'll just roll out my own
13:05 < Exx2xxO> Okay simple one this time: How can I respond with a json ? res.write(JSON.stringify()) doesn't work, res.json() doesn't work, res.send() doesn't work .. does anybody know how to respond with a json with basic node.js without any plugins?
13:06 < milani> Exx2xxO, res.send(myjson) should work fine.
13:06 < milani> oh basic http.
13:06 < Exx2xxO> nope error msg: object ServerResponse has no method 'send'
13:07 < stagas> Exx2xxO: res.write(JSON.stringify()) should work, you also need to res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json')
13:07 < milani> yes res.send is express thing.
13:08 < SomeoneWeird> res.end
13:08 < SomeoneWeird> if you're only sending that json
13:10 < Exx2xxO> okay maybe the res.write(JSON...) thing works...but why does my Ajax Post method still say: "Error" as response from my server?
13:11 < SomeoneWeird> did you restart it?
13:11 < Exx2xxO> yep
13:13 < yanivge> Hi guys
13:13 < yanivge> i am intalling "npm install perl"
13:14 < yanivge> and i get building errors:
13:14 < yanivge> anyone has any idea why?
13:14 < yanivge> here is my output
13:15 < Shinister> Yeah we'll need a hint at the output to help :P
13:15 < yanivge> http://pastie.org/5695378
13:15 < yanivge> i decided to link it and not to junk the window ;-)
13:16 < Shinister> hm, interesting
13:16 < Shinister> try a different version of perl?
13:16 < yanivge> how?
13:16 < Shinister> you can stick a version at the end of the npm command
13:17 < Shinister> npm install perl@1.4 or something (I've no idea what the perl versions are)
13:17 < Shinister> Just an idea, honestly I have 0 perl experience :)
13:17 < yanivge> npm install perl @5.8.8 ??
13:17 < Shinister> not sure there's a space
13:18 < yanivge> npm doesn't recognize this convetion
13:19 < yanivge> i have 887M available...
13:19 < Shinister> Probably fine?
13:19 < Shinister> Sorry i can't be more help
13:20 < yanivge> thanks 
13:21 < yanivge> maybe you know any other community that might have any idea

13:39 < phun-ky> anyone knows how i can use node-http-proxy to proxy from HTTP to HTTPS? the readme says its possible but no working example is given
13:45 < ExxKA> Hey guys, is it possible to set an environment variable inside a nodejs problem, which can then later be read by a process or script which is initialized later from the same process?
13:45 < ExxKA> nodejs program*
13:52 < stagas> ExxKA: process.env.FOO = 'bar' or there's an argument in .spawn to pass env vars
13:53 < ExxKA> stagas, I will try your first suggestion. It's a nodejs module I am loading, so there's no need for spawn
13:53 < ExxKA> Thank you
13:55 < Sico> I am having real problems accessing a JSON object in my .ejs file.
13:56 < SomeoneWeird> Sico, howso
13:57 < ExxKA> It worked, thanks stagas 
13:58 < phun-ky> anyone knows how i can use node-http-proxy to proxy from HTTP to HTTPS? the readme says its possible but no working example is given
13:58  * ExxKA waiting with excitement for Sico's answer
13:58 < Sico> The JSON object is created from http.get method that fetches the object from a PHP API. I assig the about to a var and send that var to an EJS. I then try this <%=data.title %> which returns "undefined"
13:59 < Sico> here is my GIST
13:59 < Sico> https://gist.github.com/4547281
13:59 < j105rob> is Express the best package for scaffolding up http apps? better options?
13:59 < SomeoneWeird> j105rob, it's one (if not the) best
14:00 < SomeoneWeird> Sico, you're rendering the page before http.get has finished
14:00 < SomeoneWeird> so yes, body will be undefined
14:00 < SomeoneWeird> under line 25 add res.on('end', function() { res.render('index', { posts: body }); });
14:04 < j105rob> thanks SomeoneWeird..
14:05 < Sico> SomeoneWeird: I get this response in my browser now No data received
14:06 < stagas> Sico: you need to rename one of the 'res' variables because the http.get one is shadowing the other
14:06 < SomeoneWeird> oh, yeah
14:06 < SomeoneWeird> that ^
14:09 < Sico> stagas, not sure I know what you mean?
14:10 < stagas> Sico: you can't have two different vars of the same name under the same scope one of the 'res' needs to be renamed
14:11 < gildean> Sico: also you need to append the body, not reassign the chunk to the body
14:11 < gildean> so instead of just = you should have +=

14:29 < Industrial> What's the best way to chop off the last directory of __dirname? I tried __dirname.replace(/\/.+$/, '') but I guess I need the non greedy version.
14:30 < flexd> mansoor-s: libuv is good for that.
14:30 < flexd> mansoor-s: look at http://nikhilm.github.com/uvbook/basics.html and the next chapter (file systems)
14:30 < flexd> I haven't used it myself yet but it seems like what you want :)
14:30 < mansoor-s> Industrial, split by /  and  join all of the parts except the last
14:31 < marmotz> hi
14:31 < exit2> hi
14:31 < Industrial> marmotz: will that work if I have e.g. /foo/bar/foo ?
14:31 < Industrial> mansoor-s: ^ *

14:38 < dob_> hi
14:42 < dob_> short question. If i add the startssl ca pem file to the ca options in my https server configuration will it then be possible to authenticate (client certificate) against my system with any startssl certificate?
14:43 < dob_> tartssl.ca-bundle.pem 
14:43 < dob_> startssl.ca-bundle.pem 
14:50 < jmar777> my google fu is failing today, so maybe someone here knows. Do typed arrays offer any way to do conversion-free bitwise operations (i.e., no float -> integer -> float conversion)?
14:52 < kpko> Hi everyone :-) Has anyone any experience in filtering spam messages with socket.io? Some users try to break my server by sending lots of messages in a short time... 
14:53 < zomg> kpko: you can just implement some sort of timeout, store a timestamp on the user and when you receive a message from them, compare against the timestamp
14:54 < zomg> would probably be a good idea to implement that on the client too to avoid the traffic altogether, assuming of course they aren't trying to break it by manually sending the messages instead of spamming the button or w/e
14:54 < AAA_awright> jmar777: Why would they?
14:55 < AAA_awright> jmar777: What are you trying to do, anyways?
14:55 < kpko> zomg: That's the problem. The user could do a manual setInterval :-)
14:55 < kpko> I want to implement this on the client AND on the server side, so that I can be sure..
14:56 < zomg> kpko: yeah, I had something like that and implemented a time based filtering like mentioned on the server
14:56 < zomg> Worked alright, I just disconnected them if they exceeded the speed. of course the app was built so that the user didn't know if they got force-disconnected...
14:56 < zomg> =)
14:56 < jmar777> AAA_awright: more of an academic question. have a trie structure for doing word lookups based purely on bitwise operations... would like to explore whether or not typed arrays hold potential for a substantial speedup
14:56 < AAA_awright> dob_: All cryptographic certificates authenticate themselves, if you want to authorize them or not is up to you
14:57 < jmar777> AAA_awright: especially with use cases like canvas pixel manipulation and what not, it makes sense to be able to do fast bit manip without jumping through floats
14:57 < gildean> isaacs: i got a npm ERR! publish Failed PUT response undefined when publishing a new version, on second attempt it worked fine, just wanted to report that
14:57 < AAA_awright> jmar777: V8 is smart enough to know if to store a float or an int in memory
14:58 < AAA_awright> It'll use either depending on what's called for
14:58 < jmar777> AAA_awright: so if I do `4 | 2`, am I conversion free?
14:59 < dob_> AAA_awright: I think that is not correct. If I add the startssl pem and try to authenticate with my startssl certificate. The server says the certificate is not approved. 
14:59 < kpko> zomg: Okay, thank you :-) I'll try to implement this in my own app.
15:00 < dob_> Only certificates signed by another cert added in the CAChain is trusted by the server. But I am not sure why it does not work with startssl. I am also not sure if I need the startssl ca in my ca option.
15:00 < AAA_awright> jmar777: The rule of thumb is don't choose one type of function call over another because of performance, so long as you're not making stupid code path structures, the ECMAScript engine changes rapidly enough your optimizations won't matter from one version to the next
15:01 < AAA_awright> The reason to choose UInt8Array is for the additional methods and range checking
15:01 < AAA_awright> Not because it's more efficent :)
15:02 < AAA_awright> dob_: I'd consider client certificate signing dangerous, it's hard to revoke certificates and such. Keep a database of approved client certificates and lookup against that.
15:02 < dob_> Do you know any examples for that?
15:02 < jmar777> AAA_awright: i appreciate that as general guidance, and I agree. the whole point of this project i'm working on, though, is how to eke out every last smidgin of performance though.
15:03 < jmar777> ugh... hate the "double though". always do that...
15:03 < AAA_awright> dob_: Just treat the certificate SHA hash as a user id
15:03 < yanivge> hi 
15:03 < yanivge>  i aske that question earlier 
15:04 < AAA_awright> dob_: You can look it up with connection.getPeerCertificate()
15:04 < dob_> AAA_awright: How can i get that hash?
15:04 < dob_> alright
15:04 < yanivge> maybe someone new joind and can help me
15:04 < yanivge> i tried to instal: npm install perl
15:04 < AAA_awright> jmar777: Well in that case you'll have to actually do performance testing on it
15:04 < AAA_awright> jmar777: If it's really that important though you might consider writing a C++ daemon
15:05 < yanivge> the installation failed
15:05 < yanivge> so does also npm install perl@1.1.4 
15:05 < yanivge> here is the putput

15:06 < bnoordhuis> someone actually wrote a node-to-perl binding? the mind boggles
15:06 < bnoordhuis> yanivge: it's a bug in the module, you should report the issue to its author
15:07 < bnoordhuis> include the contents of npm-debug.log
15:07 < brettlangdon> bnoordhuis, node makes everything better… even perl
15:07 < flexd> >> 1 << 2

15:07 < phun-ky> https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues/366 <- proxying http -> https gives 400/502 statuscodes
15:07 < flexd> Did not know you could use bitshifting in JS, isn't that a bit dangerous with floating point crap? :/
15:08 < dob_> AAA_awright: After I got the certificate. I will create a SHA over the complete certificate?
15:08 < bnoordhuis> flexd: the number is converted to an unsigned int first
15:08 < flexd> ref: stuff like http://wtfjs.com
15:09 < flexd> bnoordhuis: are you sure? Fairly certain left shift is a signed operation on 32 bit ints in js
15:09 < bnoordhuis> flexd: wait i lie, >>> is unsigned, << and >> are signed
15:10 < AAA_awright> dob_: Read the entire section on SSL/TLS in the documentation
15:11 < bnoordhuis> flexd: fun fact, the right-hand side gets converted to an unsigned int, i.e.
15:11 < bnoordhuis> >> 1 << -1
15:11 < purr> bnoordhuis: (number) -2147483648

15:14 < purr> flexd: ReferenceError: process is not defined
15:14 < bnoordhuis> it's probably just v8, not node
15:14 < flexd> haha, okay :) Off to the gym for me :)
15:15 < dob_> AAA_awright: I can't find something about creating checksums.
15:21 < AAA_awright> dob_: It's the 'fingerprint' property
15:23 < im0b> hi guys
15:24 < jvanveen> hey
15:24 < im0b> im trying to write unit tests for my api server
15:24 < jvanveen> anyone knows of an example how to process a sent ArrayBuffer with wss
15:24 < jvanveen> ?
15:24 < im0b> i cant find a repo 
15:25 < im0b> im using pusher
15:25 < im0b> so this thing https://npmjs.org/package/pusher-pipe
15:25 < im0b> is what i am looking for but it seems to be deleted from github
15:25 < im0b> where can i find any information as to where the package migrated etc
15:26 < im0b> its a pusher client for node (able to subscribe to channels)
15:30 < jvanveen> are there any image processing libraries for nodejs that can read from a buffer?
15:32 < GabrielAszalos> jvanveen: I don't know much about it, but Google-ing it gives this: http://www.jasontconnell.com/comment/image-processing-with-nodejs
15:32 < GabrielAszalos> There doesn't seem to be much support in here despite the large amount of people :)
15:32 <@Nexxy> GabrielAszalos, there is plenty of support :)
15:32 < GabrielAszalos> :D
15:32 <@Nexxy> it's just very early in the morning for a lot of people
15:32 < dob_> AAA_awright: So i just have to save the fingerprint of the certificate in my system and then do a certificat.fingerprint == stored.fingerprint?
15:32 <@Nexxy> IRC is also a very asynchronous thing
15:33 <@Nexxy> sometimes you have to wait to receive help
15:33 < GabrielAszalos> Fair enough. I take it back then.
15:33 <@Nexxy> :)
15:33 < jvanveen> GabrielAszalos: thanks :)
15:33 < AAA_awright> dob_: Correct
15:34 < jvanveen> so far i found gm and easy-image
15:34 < jvanveen> both seem to use imagemagick beneath the surcace
15:35 < AAA_awright> dob_: You could try and check the signature on the client certificate, but that's usually if you need to check that a third party signed the certificate, or something similar. I consider checking the certificate fingerprint to be more secure, because you can revoke certificates from a central location.

15:36 < jvanveen> kinda orientating what the best way is to send images as binary data over a websocket
15:36 < jvanveen> and do some image processing 
15:36 < jvanveen> maybe i better first write it to a file, and then try to process it
15:47 < dob_> AAA_awright: Last question to be sure and secure.... :-) http://pastebin.com/kfy3LxTf This is the data I get from req.connection.getPeerCertificate(). And this is the fingerprint I will have to store in my database and just do a string comparison with the string in my database.
15:47 < dob_> `Right?
15:47 < AAA_awright> dob_: Looks alright
15:48 < dob_> okay. So I will not have to create another SHAsum or fingerprint? I want to be sure the fingerprint can't be manipulated and send by the client or something like that... 
15:49 < AAA_awright> If you're interested in something similar there's also WebID, but that's really complex
15:50 < AAA_awright> dob_: It's the hash as the server receives the entire certificate including metadata, so it can't be manipulated
15:50 < AAA_awright> er, including field data

16:33 < Leeol2> For anyone more familiar with Jade.. is there a better way to do this: https://gist.github.com/0b87559c653ed1efbc15 ? The goal there, is to be able to render a page *just* containing a specific component (for ajaxy stuffs), but also be able to render a page that extends a base. Thoughts?
16:33 < Leeol2> This was the best i could come up with.. but that means for every page, there is two files.. a page, and a content (plus a base, but the base is shared among all pages.. they extend it)
16:42 < tpayne> If you were to implement navigation in node.js where you needed to know which route you were in so you can properly add an active class to the nav's li element, how would you go about doing it?
16:51 < tpayne> How do i search for available node modules
16:52 < cmoncrief> tpayne - Check this site out: https://npmjs.org/
16:52 < NoelDavies> https://npmjs.org/
16:52 < milani> tpayne, npm search does the job but it takes a while when you run for the first time
16:52 < milani> better to go to npmjs.org
16:54 < tpayne> doesn't look like there is something to make navigation easy
16:55 < milani> tpayne, when you route, you know where you are.
16:55 < milani> what is the problem?
16:56 < tpayne> figure there must be a better way
16:57 < tpayne> at the controller level
16:57 < tpayne> it's alright, i think i have an idea

17:10 < SpNg> What is the best way to log errors that would crash a node.js server, and restart the server automatically?
17:10 < TehShrike1> substack: mbalho: is voxel-engine the appropriate project to create issues for, if those issues have to do with keyboard/mouse input?
17:15 < addisonj> SpNg: handle uncaughtException: http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_event_uncaughtexception
17:16 < topaxi> SpNg: https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever
17:16 < SpNg> addisonj: will that keep the server from crashing?
17:17 < superjoe> SpNg, there is also https://github.com/indabamusic/naught which is an alternative to forever.
17:17 < SpNg> topaxi: I currently use forever. I'm looking for a way to notify me when there are errors. Right now forever restarts silently. Do you know of a way to run a script on a crash?
17:17 < addisonj> SpNg: you will want to use something outside of node to ensure a restart, the people have posted reasonable solutions, if you use ubuntu, I highly suggest just going with upstart
17:17 < SpNg> superjoe: I have not heard of that. looking at it now
17:19 < SpNg> addisonj: I'm not familiar with upstart, but this looks ideal. OS based process monitor
17:19 < addisonj> SpNg: this is what we use to deploy to out servers: https://github.com/idottv/gogogo
17:20 < addisonj> its generates upstart scripts, supports cron jobs, its really simple, but gets the job done
17:20 < topaxi> oh this one looks awsome :D
17:21 < SpNg> addisonj: ideal. I'm going to dig through some of these suggestions. Thanks for the help guys.
17:22 < superjoe> SpNg, no I do not know a way to run a script on a crash. I suppose you could tail the forever or naught logs and check for "WorkerDeath" 
17:22 < addisonj> I maintain gogogo, feel free to reach out to me (open an issue) if you run into problems using it. Its got some things tailored for our use case, but should be pretty flexible
17:23 < SpNg> superjoe: yeah that is what I'm thinking, parsing the log files and notifying. I think that might be best
17:23 < superjoe> addisonj, does gogogo let you deploy code with zero downtime?
17:24 < superjoe> addisonj, this is cool. looks like we solved similar problems with gogogo and naught.
17:25 < addisonj> superjoe, yes and no, we wrap our apps using cluster-master
17:25 < addisonj> but atm, there are some minor issues with getting signals through the subshell we create to ensure our environment is properly sourced
17:25 < addisonj> one of the things on my list to tackle... 
17:27 < superjoe> addisonj, you should play with naught, I think you would have fun
17:27 < superjoe> we made some interesting decisions differently
17:28 < addisonj> yeah, just looking at it with rodent, from your little writeup I assume you use ec2?
17:28 < superjoe> addisonj, correct
17:29 < superjoe> addisonj, but it would work with any ssh based deploy target
17:29 < addisonj> do you also use auto-scaling groups? just curious how you handle the instance changes?
17:30 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
17:30 < superjoe> we haven't had to solve auto-scaling yet. 
17:31 < rump> isaacs: will you write cpm? :)
17:31 < superjoe> addisonj, have you?
17:31 < addisonj> heh, not sure if anyone ever really "solves" autoscaling but we kinda have it working
17:31 < superjoe> haha
17:31 < addisonj> if you look at gogogo you will see a plugin that shells out to chef-knife and grabs a list of hosts to deploy too
17:32 < superjoe> the cool thing about our setup is the deploy time. I have deploy time down to 4 seconds
17:32 < superjoe> assuming that no node packages have to be downloaded
17:33 < superjoe> addisonj, nice, I'll keep that in mind when we have to solve that problem
17:33 < addisonj> yeah, thats about we are at about
17:33 < addisonj> so is your deploy based on a git push?
17:34 < superjoe> it actually executes "git fetch" on the deploy target and then "git checkout origin/<deploy_branch>"
17:34 < superjoe> the downside is that if github is down we can't deploy.
17:34 < superjoe> the upside is that it's *fucking fast*
17:35 < superjoe> addisonj, so your deploy actually pushes directly to the deploy target's git repo?
17:35 < superjoe> that's brilliant
17:35 < addisonj> correct
17:36 < addisonj> it has some downsides in that a dev can push a local branch and forget to push to origin, but we haven't really had issues
17:37 < bingomanatee> Good morning node
17:37 < qurve> Hey all, I'm working on developing an app that uses node/npm only to install coffee-script/codo/jison for a project that is not actually node application itself. I'm trying to figure out the most appropriate way to vendor these dependencies directly into the repo.
17:38 < bingomanatee> Is there any such thing as an EJS lint, to test an EJS block for goodness?
17:38 < qurve> It seems like I can put a package_info.json into the root of the repo and it will install the npm libraries into node-modules/ ?
17:39 < qurve> I come from a ruby background, so in my head I'm trying to do something similar to the way Bundler works with a Gemfile and the ability for it to freeze your rubygems into a vendor/ directory.
17:39 < qurve> Am I thinking about this all wrong? Basically my requirement is no dependencies for this project can be retrieved from the Internet. They have to be completely contained within the repo itself.
17:39 < qurve> (A requirement laid out by the client's infosec group)
17:40 < bingomanatee> qurve: NPM does bundlers job but it is not buildler.
17:40 < bingomanatee> bundler.
17:40 < bingomanatee> There is no "global namespace of modules"
17:40 < qurve> Is my understanding correct that I can simply outline my dependencies in package_info.json and if I npm install it will detect that and install them into node_modules/?
17:41 < bingomanatee> each module require is intrinsic to the context that called it; the modules are singletons, but for instance, if I require underscore from "./my/lib/a/underscore'
17:41 < bingomanatee> it is not the same underscore as require('./my/lib/b/underscore')
17:41 < bingomanatee> and it doesn't have to have the same API,  or be the same version.
17:41 < bingomanatee> curve yes. 
17:41 < qurve> Yeah, I understand the AMD pattern, this is mostly for setting someone up who has just checked out the source code and needs to get all the dependencies installed.
17:42 < qurve> Awesome, is it possible to change the node_modules/ path?
17:42 < bingomanatee> no, BUT
17:42 < qurve> Like, is there a way to make npm read/write from a different folder?
17:43 < bingomanatee> if you have a node_moudles in-between your global node modules and a given path, it will chose the first one it finds that satisfies the request.
17:43 < qurve> (I'm hoping to put all these dependencies between ruby, node, etc in a single dependencies/node_modules and dependencies/gems or something
17:43 < bingomanatee> so if you have proj_root/node_modules/bar, and you call it from proj_root/a/b/c/foo.js, 
17:44 < bingomanatee> and there is a node_modules folder at a/b/node_modules 
17:44 < bingomanatee> AND a/b/node_modules contains a module you require without specifying path ( require('vey') )
17:44 < bingomanatee> a/b/node_modules/vey will intercept and satisfy the require.
17:44 < bingomanatee> THAT BEING SAID 
17:45 < TonkaTruck> Question: Say I'm working on a project and I add a dependency to my package.json "dependencies".  If I run npm update will it install that new missing dependency?
17:45 < qurve> That makes sense, I gotta figure out how this works into my project, since I am not a node project, I don't ever require any of these modules.
17:45 < qurve> Basically, my projects needs coffeescript to build it's source, but none of that source is a node app.
17:45 < qurve> I just need coffeescript to be available.
17:45 < bingomanatee> right
17:46 < qurve> So I need to have the npm install coffeescript pull from the vendored package, not pull from the internet.
17:46 < bingomanatee> You can call node from the console, so in ruby you can call a node subfolder script as a subprocess exec and feed it the path of your source/dest folders
17:46 < qurve> OK, I'll just have to dig in and try this I guess.
17:46 < qurve> :)
17:46 < bingomanatee> you can even call npm install from ruby exec, but of course, node/npm has to be present in the system.
17:46 < bingomanatee> good luck
17:46 < qurve> Yeah, I'm downloading node/npm installers and including them as well.
17:46 < bingomanatee> thank you, come again</apu>
17:47 < qurve> The InfoSec group at the client is literally like "You need to distribute all dependencies yourself, nothing can be pulled from third parties"
17:47 < bingomanatee> fuck em
17:47 < qurve> Which I understand, now I just gotta figure out how to make 3 different systems all work together in some reasonable way.
17:48 < qurve> We use guard (ruby gem) to handle the build process, but it ultimately relies on coffeescript to do it's job.
17:48 < qurve> So I have ruby, rubygems, bundler, node, npm etc.
17:48 < qurve> At the end of this whole thing it just spits put a static website.
17:49 < gildean> qurve: haha, that's a good bit of overhead just to create static sites
17:49 < qurve> Well, it's a huge, huge Backbone.js web app.
17:49 < qurve> We're only repsonsible for the client-side, all data manip is done through a service layer that someone else implements.
17:50 < qurve> We use compass/haml/coffeescript to build it all, and guard handles the compliation from src/ to bin/
17:50 < qurve> Then we just provide them a .zip of the bin/ directory which they can deploy.
17:51 < qurve> But shortly we're going ot be sharing the raw source which they will be building themselves, hence the situation I'm now in since they refuse to install dependencies from the Internet.
17:56 < emilsedgh> isaacs:  i think i might've made mistakes regarding my package on npm, would you mind taking a look? https://npmjs.org/package/pdu.js
17:56 < qurve> Last dumb question, is it possible to have a package.json that only has dependencies?
17:57 < emilsedgh> isaacs: excuse me for highlighting you personally. im not sure where to put this or who else to poke.
17:57 < phun-ky> qurve: like this? https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/examples/package.json
17:57 < qurve> Kind of, I don't even really need a name/desciription/version since my thing isn't actually a node app/lib
17:57 < qurve> Although I can put fake values in.
17:59 < shihan> you have to have at least a name and version in a package.json file iirc
17:59 < superjoe> emilsedgh, ha, this looks like an npm bug
17:59 < qurve> Yeah, I just put in dummy values. Then I ran npm install and now I have node_modules/ in the root of my project, excellent.
18:00 <@isaacs> emilsedgh: do you mean https://npmjs.org/package/pdu?
18:00 < superjoe> npm install undefined
18:00 <@isaacs> emilsedgh: looks like i'm not properly 404-ing, thouhg.  that's a bug
18:00 < qurve> Now the only question is if I can move ./node_modules to ./dependencies/node_modules and have it all still work.
18:00 < superjoe> qurve, why are you trying to be non-standard?
18:00 < emilsedgh> isaacs: well, i first published it as 'pdu.js', then realized that and published it as 'pdu'. then tried unpublishing all versions of 'pdu.js'
18:01 < emilsedgh> superjoe: ^
18:01 < qurve> superjoe, because my "app" is not a node app.
18:01 < superjoe> qurve, are you sure?
18:01 < qurve> I have multiple third party dependencies, some are node, some are rubygems.
18:01 < qurve> Yes :)
18:01 <@isaacs> emilsedgh: yeah.  i think unpublish doesn't get handled properly in the website
18:01 < qurve> The only reason I even need node at all is because my build process compiles coffeescript
18:01 < qurve> But the app itself is not node.
18:01 < shihan> you can tell node where to find modules with node_path environment variable...
18:02 < qurve> I also use codo to generate documentation
18:02 < qurve> Shihan, can you also use that env variable to tell it where to write them out when you npm install?
18:02 <@isaacs> qurve: i'ts probably simplest to put node_modules in the root of your project.  but it's not absolutely necessary.
18:03 <@isaacs> qurve: npm_prefix=./dependencies npm install
18:03 <@isaacs> er, no
18:03 < emilsedgh> isaacs: i see. i was worried a bit that i should not have done that unpublishing.
18:03 <@isaacs> qurve: npm_config_prefix=./dependencies npm install
18:03 < qurve> Rad, I'll try it out and make sure it still works.
18:03 <@isaacs> qurve: the reason it's probably simplest is just that it's one less thing to explain to users
18:03 < qurve> In the end if it has to be in ./node_modules, that's fine, I was just hoping that I could put all these vendored libs (npm, gems, installers, etc.) in a ./dependencies folder.
18:04 <@isaacs> of course
18:04 <@isaacs> qurve: from the pov of the modules IN dependencies, it doesn't amtter, because they'll walk up until they find a node_modules folder.
18:04 <@isaacs> qurve: it's just one more stat() when they do require('coffee-script')
18:04 <@isaacs> no biggir
18:04 < qurve> Yeah that's what I figured, my thing here is simply just an organizational issue.
18:04 <@isaacs> *biggie
18:04  * isaacs ack
18:05 < qurve> This is ONLY used for build/compilation, not runtime.
18:11 < qurve> Thanks to all of you for helping me with this BTW.
18:11 < qurve> I've definitely got the problem solved, now it's just a matter of seeing if I can solve it cleaner.

18:57 < isaacbw> did you do game development?
18:57 < andu> more game art content.. tiles and textures, concept art etc
18:58 < isaacbw> mm
18:58 < andu> was tv/film work mostly
18:58 < andu> and got into web and exploded into node and robots and camera rigs

19:03 < CoverSlide> andu: have you worked with blender?
19:03 < Deathspike> Heyya. Does anyone know how I can launch a node app into the background on Windows?
19:03 < andu> yeah blender is quite awesome.. cycles is great too
19:04 < andu> not as efficient as maya data wise etc, but its really good
19:04 < kamoricks> Deathspike: Create a bat script, start with @echo off, and signal the program execution.
19:04 < kamoricks> Deathspike: Unless you mean at a different priority level.
19:04 < Deathspike> kamoricks: That's pretty much what I am after, however on Windows, a huge node window appears when doing that.
19:05 < Deathspike> Or the command prompt just 'hangs'
19:05 < CoverSlide> maybe make a service
19:05 < CoverSlide> windows and services ... that's always fun
19:05 < phun-ky> anyone got a working example of proxying http requests to https?
19:05 < kamoricks> Service doesn't help, because if it has an associated console window, it'll still show that window.
19:05 < CoverSlide> phun-ky: why would you do that?
19:06 < k_89> can someone tell me why this package.json : http://paste.laravel.com/fR4 is giving this error: http://paste.laravel.com/fR5
19:06 < phun-ky> CoverSlide: for website development inhouse there's certain things behind a https server (dont ask me why, im just a consultant) that we need certain http requests to go to, nginx did this just fine, but we want to do this with node instead
19:07 < andu> omg.. this just happened in my country.. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Man-locks-up-drunk-cop-20130116    Russell George explains how he locked up an allegedly drunk police officer in the back of his own police van. (The Witness)
19:07 < CoverSlide> i say stick with nginx for this, you'll have fewer headaches
19:08 < andu> nginx gave me problems with sockets :/ ymmv
19:08 < clondon> k_89 does it have something to do with the -alpha5 in the mysql version?
19:08 < phun-ky> CoverSlide: yeah, it gave me headaches and grey hair already..

19:10 < hipsterslapfight> andu: only older versions of nginx have sockets issues
19:10 < hipsterslapfight> newer versions use http1.1
19:10 < k_89> clondon: no idea, but that was the version on the npmjs site. Changed package.json to this: http://paste.laravel.com/fRc
19:11 < k_89> still the same error
19:13 < clondon> k_89 sorry I'm new at this stuff so I might not be a help but does your package.json file need a version?
19:13 < CoverSlide> k_89: add a "version" field
19:13 < CoverSlide> "version": "0.0.0
19:13 < cdc> is it efficient/not-load-consuming to have a large number, say, 1000+ setTimeouts polling at the same time?
19:15 < k_89> CoverSlide: clondon thanks, yeah that was the problem, "console.log"-ed it out :P
19:15 < CoverSlide> that's a pretty insane number
19:15 < CoverSlide> TIAS
19:15 < andu> hipsterslapfight, good to know thx
19:18 < TonkaTruck> What's a good module for an ORM?  I need something to complement Restify with mongo probably.
19:18 < cdc> CoverSlide: yeah, thats why I asked =x
19:19 < CoverSlide> the standard mongo odm for node is mongoose
19:19 < CoverSlide> if there are others, they aren't doing a good job of advertising
19:22 < TonkaTruck> CoverSlide: Thanks.  
19:28 < foxjazz> whats the best way to take the source of a module and include it without installing the module?
19:30 < CoverSlide> some fs and vm hackery
19:30 < CoverSlide> just for shits ang giggles, why do you want to do this?
19:32 < phrearch> hi
19:32 < phrearch> im looking for a way to serialize an arraybuffer really quick in the browser. is that even possible atm?
19:32 < phrearch> ive tried both bison and msgpack on an arraybuffer of 1200 kb. that was just slow :(
19:33 < CoverSlide> yikes
19:33 < phrearch> i must be doing something wrong obviously
19:34 < phrearch> sending the arraybuffer direcly over the websocket is fast, but then i have no way to do any kind of routing
19:34 < phrearch> or is there?
19:35  * CoverSlide shrugs
19:37 < Leeol2> Anyone familiar with how to identify google as a client in your request? 
19:40 < Leeol2> As far as i can tell, manually checking the user agent against this giant pile is the only way: http://www.jafsoft.com/searchengines/webbots.html
19:40 < Leeol2> Seems rather extreme
19:47 < CoverSlide> http://rapfix.mtv.com/2013/01/16/kris-kross-to-reunite-for-so-so-def-anniversary-concert/
19:48 < CoverSlide> if you want to disable all bots, just use a general robots.txt disallow thing
19:49 < CoverSlide> if you want to know if it's google bot, check for that one
19:49 < CoverSlide> if you want to know if it's any bot? well good luck, cause anyone can make a bot and name it whatever they want
19:54 < Leeol2> CoverSlide: Well, any "sane" bot, i guess. I was more hoping for an identifier that was accepted standard. Eg, any bot that wants itself to be known as a bot, prefixes it's useragent with "bot-" or something
19:54 < Leeol2> But, from what i am seeing, there isn't one
19:54 < kamoricks> Nice bots obey robots.txt.

20:34 < triptec> is there any documentation on basic stuff like array functions for node?
20:34 < triptec> I tried nodemanual but it seems to be down
20:35 < s5fs> triptec: you probably want a javascript language reference for that
20:36 < s5fs> triptec: i usually use google for spot-checking things like array usage, but the mdn docs are good (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript)

20:46 < `3rdEden> when you stream.pipe(dest); the dest should have it's end or destroy function called when the stream emit's it's end or close events right?

21:00 < TonkaTruck> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11237269/node-js-requiring-mongoose-here-and-there-causes-redundancy This looks like a nice way to do it.  Is there a better way?  Mongoose schemas all in one place and models get their own file.
21:03 < mscdex> `3rdEden: possibly not if there is some data buffered to be written to dest yet
21:06 < `3rdEden> mscdex: what do you mean, if there's data buffered waiting to be written, then the source wouldn't even emit close/end
21:25 < foxjazz_> anyone play with kohai?
21:25 < cronopio> foxjazz_: some time ago

21:26 < foxjazz_> trying to figure out how to run it
21:26 < foxjazz_> I modified the config file with my data, but the running doesn't work from node.
21:29 < cronopio> foxjazz_: well, Im not sure about the actual status of the project with the latest version of node. But as far as I know just set the irc server the channel and the nickname to use
21:41 < brianloveswords> Does anyone know how to get openssl to list all public key algorithms on OS X? `openssl list-public-key-algorithms` doesn't work for me.

23:19 < AviMarcus> Hey. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions for this? I'm doing billing for some small info lookups, so I'll have upto ~50k/transactions per second. I need to store date, originating IP, accountcode, 8byte number = less than 50 bytes? ~2.4megabytes/second of raw data. Any suggestions on DBs for this high-volume, small data write load?
23:21 < sear> Hi all.  I'm new to node and I was wondering if it's possible to set a timeout on tcp connections before they connect.  i.e. If it takes longer than x seconds to connect, the timeout event is emitted.
23:21 < AviMarcus> sear, http://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_settimeout_timeout_callback ??
23:22 < sear> AviMarcus, I saw that, but it was unclear to me whether that could be specified before the connection was made.
23:23 < AviMarcus> sear, looks like it. You create the socket before telling it to connect.
23:23 < AviMarcus> oh uhm.
23:24 < sear> AviMarcus, thanks for the input.  I'll give it a go.
23:24 < sear> Oh uhm. ?
23:24 < AviMarcus> under socket.connect it says: "Normally this method is not needed, as net.createConnection opens the socket. Use this only if you are implementing a custom Socket or if a Socket is closed and you want to reuse it to connect to another server."
23:25 < sear> Hmm, yeah.  That does pose an issue, then.
23:32 < jack150> AviMarcus: thought about redis?
23:33 < AviMarcus> jack150, redis is great for a running total -- will it do well storing the actual rows of data, though..?
23:35 < jack150> never had to deal with your number of transactions, not even close, but youporn uses it and handles 300k requests/sec, but well, that's requests
23:36 < jack150> :)
23:36 < AviMarcus> jack150, I presume that mostly reads and then view incrementors... not full audit trail
23:37 < jack150> AviMarcus: the lead developer even talked about it, I'm sure it's on youtube: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/redis-db/d4QcWV0p-YM
23:39 < Draggor> I'm using SequelizeJS trying to hook up to a postgres install, but I get this lovely little error: Error: Unrecognized message code 74
23:45 < jack150> AviMarcus: here is his talk, haven't watched it though, don't know if it's useful for you, my guess its focus is on reads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlkCdM_f3p4
23:46 < AviMarcus> jack150, is that SFW?
23:47 < jack150> AviMarcus: yes, of course, it's tech only
23:47 < AviMarcus> :)
23:48 < exit2> I need someone to test my application
23:56 < jack150> exit2: details?
23:56 < exit2> jack150: it's a proximity chat application created with socket.io
23:58 < jack150> exit2: so only people close to each other can chat?
23:58 < addisonj> hrm... anyone know of a image resizing/conversion that uses a native library? I don't want to shell out
23:58 < Havvy> You must be within 2 feet to chat.
23:59 < addisonj> node-vips, but it looks pretty old
23:59 < exit2> jack150: yes, at this point the threshold is 1mi
23:59 < exit2> Havvy: good idea :P
23:59 < whomp_> this boilerplate https server only returns data to the web browser when i kill the server: http://pastebin.com/u5XiWYde  why?
