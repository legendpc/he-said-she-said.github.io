I'm trying set up monit to stop a script when it uses too much cpu. "sudo /bin/bash -c '/bin/kill -15 `cat /var/run/messenger.pid`'" works to stop it but stop program  = "/bin/bash -c '/bin/kill -15 `cat /var/run/messenger.pid`'" in monit config isn't working. Even when I "sudo monit stop all" it doesn't stop it.
