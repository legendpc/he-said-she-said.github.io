Hi, I'm working on a node app that streams twitter statuses to the client using socket.io and ntwitter. My code is as follows, and it seems to work fine: https://gist.github.com/RyanNielson/5408422 . But for some reason I think it could be written better. Any suggestions? I'm a node noob so I may be approaching this wrong.
