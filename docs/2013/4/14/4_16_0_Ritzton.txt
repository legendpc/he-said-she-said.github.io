I managed to use session with socket io with this example : https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/588#issuecomment-10271868 but I would like to know how I can update session for it to not expire ? I tried to do this http://pastebin.com/cSvQJUy7 but the problem is when I open 2 browser I am catching the session of the other browser
